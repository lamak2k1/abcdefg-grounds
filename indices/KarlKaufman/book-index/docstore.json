Stalwart - Huge companies that don\u2019t grow too fast in the short-term but have solid prospects\n     for long-term growth. Traits would be increasing dividends, excellent cash flow, and limited debt.\n\nb.   Slow Grower - Similar sized company to Stalwart, but its fast-growth years are well behind it.\n\nc.   Fast Grower        - Usually early phase companies with rapid growth along with a potentially\n     volatile stock price. Many Fast Growers do not have significant earnings, but the stock price\n     is traded up based on potential earnings and continued innovation. Breaking news relating to\n     their operations can dramatically affect the share price.\n\nd.   Cyclical - Companies whose profits rise and fall based on economic cycles. For example, when\n     the economy is booming, the automotive industry tends to do well, as consumers have more\n     money to upgrade their vehicles. When there\u2019s a recession, companies in the consumer staples\n     sector, such as those that sell cigarettes or food, usually do well since people always need to\n     restock these items.\n\ne.   Turnaround - These companies have been battered down or depressed, and no growth or\n     even negative growth has left them in poor shape. Think airline and travel/leisure companies\n     throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Often, the company will bring in a new CEO to try and\n     turn around its fortunes.\n\nf.

Stalwart - Huge companies that don\u2019t grow too fast in the short-term but have solid prospects for long-term growth. Traits would be increasing dividends, excellent cash flow, and limited debt.\n\nb. Slow Grower - Similar sized company to Stalwart, but its fast-growth years are well behind it.\n\nc. Fast Grower - Usually early phase companies with rapid growth along with a potentially volatile stock price. Many Fast Growers do not have significant earnings, but the stock price is traded up based on potential earnings and continued innovation. Breaking news relating to their operations can dramatically affect the share price.\n\nd. Cyclical - Companies whose profits rise and fall based on economic cycles. For example, when the economy is booming, the automotive industry tends to do well, as consumers have more money to upgrade their vehicles. When there\u2019s a recession, companies in the consumer staples sector, such as those that sell cigarettes or food, usually do well since people always need to restock these items.\n\ne.

On that date, the dividend\nis taken from the share price and paid to shareholders who\u2019ve owned the stock at least one\nday before the ex-dividend date.\n\nAssuming Home Depot\u2019s ex-dividend date is September 2nd, we\u2019ll receive $1.65 per\nshare as long as we owned the stock on or before September 1st. If the stock closes the\ntrading day on September 1st at $331.65, that $1.65 dividend payment gets taken out of\nthe share price. The next day, September 2nd, Home Depot will start trading at $330.00\n($331.65 - $1.65 = $330.00).\n\nThe share price and yield have an inverse relationship: as the price rises, the yield goes\ndown and vice versa. If Home Depot\u2019s share price climbs to $340, the yield would now\nbe 1.94% ($6.60 / $340).\n\nWhen interest rates are low, dividend stocks are more in favor.

Stalwart - Huge companies that don\u2019t grow too fast in the short-term but have solid prospects\n     for long-term growth. Traits would be increasing dividends, excellent cash flow, and limited debt.\n\nb.   Slow Grower - Similar sized company to Stalwart, but its fast-growth years are well behind it.\n\nc.   Fast Grower        - Usually early phase companies with rapid growth along with a potentially\n     volatile stock price. Many Fast Growers do not have significant earnings, but the stock price\n     is traded up based on potential earnings and continued innovation. Breaking news relating to\n     their operations can dramatically affect the share price.\n\nd.   Cyclical - Companies whose profits rise and fall based on economic cycles. For example, when\n     the economy is booming, the automotive industry tends to do well, as consumers have more\n     money to upgrade their vehicles. When there\u2019s a recession, companies in the consumer staples\n     sector, such as those that sell cigarettes or food, usually do well since people always need to\n     restock these items.\n\ne.   Turnaround - These companies have been battered down or depressed, and no growth or\n     even negative growth has left them in poor shape. Think airline and travel/leisure companies\n     throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Often, the company will bring in a new CEO to try and\n     turn around its fortunes.\n\nf.

Stalwart - Huge companies that don\u2019t grow too fast in the short-term but have solid prospects\n     for long-term growth. Traits would be increasing dividends, excellent cash flow, and limited debt.\n\nb.   Slow Grower - Similar sized company to Stalwart, but its fast-growth years are well behind it.\n\nc.   Fast Grower        - Usually early phase companies with rapid growth along with a potentially\n     volatile stock price. Many Fast Growers do not have significant earnings, but the stock price\n     is traded up based on potential earnings and continued innovation. Breaking news relating to\n     their operations can dramatically affect the share price.\n\nd.   Cyclical - Companies whose profits rise and fall based on economic cycles. For example, when\n     the economy is booming, the automotive industry tends to do well, as consumers have more\n     money to upgrade their vehicles. When there\u2019s a recession, companies in the consumer staples\n     sector, such as those that sell cigarettes or food, usually do well since people always need to\n     restock these items.\n\ne.   Turnaround - These companies have been battered down or depressed, and no growth or\n     even negative growth has left them in poor shape. Think airline and travel/leisure companies\n     throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Often, the company will bring in a new CEO to try and\n     turn around its fortunes.\n\nf.

Since Home Depot pays a quarterly dividend, we\u2019ll receive a payment of $1.65 per share every three months as a shareholder.\n\namericandreaminvesting.com 25", "bBox": {"x": 35, "y": 374, "w": 545.982200000001, "h": 24}}], "page_id": "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xS1-j72z7VtjQEP7aw7FNXagVFLrWUmV/view"}}, "ae2bf792-2660-44cb-a2fa-9e3ef507caf0": {"node_ids": ["e9cd856d-a4ac-4b08-83f2-276735930603"], "metadata": {"page": 26, "text": "                                                                      T H E U L T I M A T E P R O F I T P L A Y B O O K\n     S(VIDENDS\nThe dividend is paid on what is known as the\u201cEx-Dividend\u201d date.

It\u2019s also helpful to save them for\n   historical records.\n\n   At American Dream Investing, our investment process begins with\n   this level of detailed analysis.\n\n   As we begin to build a position in a stock, one strategy we employ is\n   to not purchase all the desired shares at once. For example, if our goal\n   were to invest $50,000 into a company, we would start by initiating\n   a $25,000 position, waiting and watching the stock\u2019s short-term\n   movements before investing more. Here\u2019s why:\n\n   We want to test our hypothesis to see if we were correct before buying\n   more. The stock could dip in the near-term if there are unforeseen\n   events in the broader market. We would then average down our cost-\n   basis without stretching ourselves and investing more than initially\n   planned.\n\n   If the stock rises, it\u2019s a good sign we were correct. We can then continue\n   adding to the position over time as we gain experience owning the\n   stock and tracking its price movements.\n\n   Our success comes from thorough fundamental analysis, monitoring\n   the market and the companies we hold every day, and executing well-\n   developed investing strategies like the one above.\n\n                                                  americandreaminvesting.com          46", "md": "# Putting It All Together\n\nCongratulations!

These include materials,\n     labor, and manufacturing overhead directly used to create the product. Indirect costs, or those\n     not involved directly in the production of the good, are excluded. A higher COGS results in lower\n     margins.\n     Current Ratio\n     A ratio that measures a company\u2019s short-term liquidity. The time frame of \u201ccurrent\u201d signifies within\n     one year. It compares a company\u2019s Current Assets to its Current Liabilities that will be earned and\n     paid, respectively, within the next year. The Current Ratio provides insight into the company\u2019s\n     ability to cover its short-term debt with its Current Assets.\n\n     Dividends\n     The distribution of a portion of a company\u2019s earnings to shareholders. Typically, a fast-growing\n     company will not pay out dividends, as they reinvest their earnings in continued growth. Dividend-\n     paying companies are almost always well-established companies with a long history of earnings.\n\n     Dividend Yield\n     The calculation of the total annual dividends divided by the current share price.
