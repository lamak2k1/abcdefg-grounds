Slack\u2019s\n founders recognized the inefficiencies in existing communica-\n tion tools and set out to create a product that would solve these\n problems.\n   In the early stages of developing Slack, the team faced the\n temptation to add numerous features to create a comprehensive,\n all-in-one tool. However, they recognized that attempting to\n do too much could lead to delays, a lack of focus, and a product\n that didn\u2019t effectively meet its core needs.\n   The team adopted a lean startup approach, aiming to build\n a minimal viable product (MVP) quickly to test the market.\nThey created a stripped-down version of what would become\n Slack and began testing it with a small group of users to gather\n feedback.\n   Slack\u2019s MVP was centered around a few key features: The\n core function of Slack was to provide a seamless real-time\n messaging platform for teams. Instead of losing important\n conversations in email threads, Slack allowed users to search\n past messages easily.

Now, it\u2019s time to plan the development process. Proper planning is key to staying on track and ensuring that your MVP is built efficiently. In this chapter, we\u2019ll focus on creating a detailed development roadmap, setting milestones, and assembling your team. By the end of this chapter, you\u2019ll have a clear plan that will guide your next steps.\nSection 1: Creating a Development Roadmap\nA development roadmap is a strategic plan that outlines the path to building your MVP. It breaks down the entire process into manageable steps, helping you stay organized and focused. A well-structured roadmap is essential for tracking progress, managing resources, and ensuring that your MVP is completed on time.\n\nSteps to Create a Roadmap:\n\n19", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 908, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "058d70a8-a5f1-4eba-bc87-e9683b2f815b": {"__data__": {"id_": "058d70a8-a5f1-4eba-bc87-e9683b2f815b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page": 26, "text": "                              ZERO\u2192MVP IN 90 DAYS\n\n   1.

In this methodology, development tasks are organized into short, focused periods called sprints (typically 1-2 weeks). Each sprint has specific goals and deliverables, allowing your team to progress and adapt quickly to changes continuously.\n\nSteps for Effective Sprint Planning:\n\n1. Define Sprint Goals: Start by identifying the key features or tasks to be completed during the sprint. These should align with the priorities set in your roadmap.\n2. Break Down Tasks: Break down each feature into smaller, actionable tasks that can be completed within the sprint. Assign tasks to team members based on their skills and availability.\n3. Estimate Effort: Estimate the time and effort required for each task, considering complexity and dependencies.\n4. Create a Sprint Backlog: Compile the tasks into a sprint backlog, which serves as the to-do list for the sprint.\n5. Daily Stand-Ups: Hold brief daily meetings to discuss progress, address roadblocks, and adjust tasks as needed.\n\nExample: The following is a simple sprint plan for a SaaS MVP, showing how development work is organized, assigned, and tracked throughout the sprint.\n\n41", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1294, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "8a061736-a1dd-40a6-9f68-22a863541180": {"__data__": {"id_": "8a061736-a1dd-40a6-9f68-22a863541180", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page": 48, "text": "                              ZERO\u2192MVP IN 90 DAYS\n                                              TA Sprint 1\n            Backio -\n                     00\n                                                                  40\n      Picture: A sample sprint plan for the Testimonial website\n\nSection 3: Coding Core Features \u2013 Focused\nDevelopment\n\nIn the MVP stage, it\u2019s crucial to focus on building the core\nfeatures that directly address the problem you\u2019re solving.

Deploy in Stages: To minimize risk, start by deploying to a small group of users (often referred to as a soft launch or beta release). Gradually, roll out to a larger audience as confidence in the product\u2019s stability increases.\n\n4. Monitor Performance: Use monitoring tools like New Relic or Datadog to track your application\u2019s performance in real-time. Monitor key metrics such as server response times, error rates, and user load.\nBest Practices for Deployment:\n- Backup Data: Always back up your databases and key resources before deploying new changes.\n- Rollbacks: Be prepared with a rollback plan if the deployment introduces critical issues.\n- Notify Users: Inform your users about the deployment, especially if it involves downtime or major changes.\n\nExample: Asana is a project management tool founded by Dustin Moskovitz and Justin Rosenstein in 2008. To ensure that their MVP was reliable and user-friendly, Asana implemented CI/CD pipelines and phased rollouts to manage their deployment process.

Metrics help you assess\nuser engagement, identify areas for improvement, and make\ndata-driven decisions for future growth.\n  Key Metrics to Track:\n\n   1. User Acquisition: Measure the number of new users sign-\n      ing up or purchasing your product. Key metrics include\n      customer acquisition cost (CAC) and conversion rates.\n   2. User Engagement: Track how users are interacting with\n      your product. Metrics like daily active users (DAU), session\n      duration, and feature usage can provide user satisfaction\n      and engagement insights.\n   3.

Iterate Based on Feedback: Adjust the prototype based\n       on user feedback, refining the design until it meets user\n       expectations.\n\nTools for Prototyping:\n\n   \u2022 Lucid: A tool specifically designed for creating interactive,\n      clickable prototypes from your designs.\n   \u2022 Adobe XD: Offers robust prototyping features alongside\n      design tools.\n   \u2022 Figma: Combines design and prototyping in one platform,\n      allowing for seamless transitions between the two.\n\n Example: Stanford graduates Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger\n founded Instagram as a check-in and photo-sharing app. They\n used rapid prototyping to pivot product design based on user\n feedback, leading to a more successful MVP.\n   Instagram started as \u201cBurbn,\u201d a location-based check-in app\nwith multiple features, such as photo-sharing, check-ins, and\n social gaming. However, users found the app too cluttered and\n confusing.\n   The founders noticed that the photo-sharing feature was the\n most popular.\n   They quickly prototyped a simplified version focusing solely\n on photo-sharing with filters. This minimalist prototype fo-\n cused on images, comments, and \u201cliking\u201d features.
