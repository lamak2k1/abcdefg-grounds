When selling a company, you run the risk of losing the very thing you worked hard to create. A venture capitalist may not share the same ideals as you do, especially when their primary concern is a return on their investment.\n\n1 April 2021\n\nIn contrast, an IPO allows you to retain management control of your company and continue to choose how you want to manage it along with board oversight.\n\nListing on a Senior Stock Exchange and going through the IPO processes is an excellent opportunity for entrepreneurial growth companies to access capital and enter capital markets. A micro-IPO is more accessible than ever before, and is a valuable and essential vehicle to access growth capital.\n\nThere\u2019s been a return to the high volume of IPOs seen during the dot-com era of the 1990s. However, after the dot-com bust, the Wall Street myth that small IPOs are too expensive and risky became widely accepted. During the dot-com bust, the notion that a small company should not take on the risk or burden of the costs, obligations and potential liability of an IPO became commonplace. This myth, perpetuated over the past 20 years, has created a barrier to entry at a considerable cost to entrepreneurs, investors and the world.\n\nAn IPO is perhaps more within reach than you might imagine and could be a significant way for your company to grow, access capital and gain market share.\n\nThe next installment of this monthly articles series will discuss how to access a [micro-IPO](https://exchangelistingllc.com/) and how to prepare for one.\n\ncontact [https://exchangelistingllc.com](https://exchangelistingllc.com/) and [Emmis Capital](https://emmiscap.com/)\u00a0\n\n## [Trading Strategy](https://emmiscap.com/trading-strategy/)\n\nWith even two trades per month with this strategy, you will start seeing the difference in your trading account.

With the year only half over, U.S. IPOs have already totaled $171 billion, beating the record amount set last year.\n\n1 April 2021\n\nSPACs (a company created to merge with another company and take it public) have also been red hot. There were $166 billion in SPAC deals in just the first quarter of this year, exceeding the volume in all of 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement. But going public is a time-consuming, challenging process that is difficult for most small and mid-sized private companies to navigate alone.\n\nThere are so many questions to answer, such as: Is an IPO the right move for our company? What will we use the IPO proceeds for? Is our company financially strong enough to go public?  \nHow should the IPO be structured? What type of corporate governance do we need? What are the listing requirements of the target exchange? What experts should we rely on for advice?\n\nPreparation is critical. It can take many months, if not longer, to launch an IPO. Companies that aren\u2019t fully prepared will struggle to fully leverage the opportunities provided by an IPO to raise capital and fund growth.\n\nThat\u2019s why you should consider partnering with a pre-IPO advisor who can help answer those kinds of questions, design a strategy for going public and manage the team of professionals needed to plan and execute an IPO. That team typically includes bankers, legal counsel, auditors, investor relations experts and others.\n\nHere are five ways a pre-IPO advisor can guide you through the highly specialized and complex IPO process:\n\n*   They can structure your company to attract investors and the right investment banker, and are adept at telling the company\u2019s story and defending its capital market strategy.\n*   They can advise how to set up internal systems and controls that enable the scale needed to launch an IPO.\n*   They can provide valuable expertise in pre-IPO financial planning and analysis.\n*   They can set up proper internal governance practices to ensure the company has a diverse mix of directors with the right experience.\n*   They can identify, help select and coordinate an experienced team of experts to assist with underwriting, accounting, legal, regulatory compliance and corporate governance.\n\nHas your company worked with a [pre-IPO Advisor?](https://emmiscap.com/)\n\n## [Trading Strategy](https://emmiscap.com/trading-strategy/)\n\nWith even two trades per month with this strategy, you will start seeing the difference in your trading account.

These accomplishments should be applauded, and at the same time, you may be wondering about future expansion, possible acquisitions or even an exit strategy.\n\n1 April 2021\n\nAt this point, many owners of small and mid sized companies wonder if going public is something they should consider.\n\nAs a successful entrepreneur and a seasoned C-Suite executive, I am often asked, \u201cwhy should I take my small-to mid-sized company public?\u201d\n\nAn initial public offering (IPO) is a bold step that can help firms elevate company awareness, raise capital and increase liquidity. As you consider the next steps in your company\u2019s lifecycle, let\u2019s look at the top reasons to go public.\n\n*   **Raising Capital**\u2014 Creating more capital-raising opportunities and financing options is one of the primary reasons companies decide to go public. An IPO can typically provide firms with a higher valuation and a lower cost of capital, offering companies the potential to grow their business more significantly than with other sources of capital, such as bank loans or venture capitalists.\n*   **Establishing a Value**\u00a0\u2014 The comprehensive IPO evaluation process uses analysis and modeling to determine a company\u2019s fair and reasonable valuation. But ultimately, investors will determine what a company is worth in the public market.\n*   **Increasing Liquidity**\u00a0\u2014 Offering shares through an IPO creates a liquidity event for founders and original investors, generating an opportunity to more easily cash out some or all of their shares as well as an exit strategy for angel investors, venture capitalists and institutional investors. An IPO also increases liquidity for future investors.\n*   **Establishing Public Awareness**\u00a0\u2014 Presence on an exchange typically translates into increased visibility, which may, in turn, generate greater interest and awareness of the company to a new group of potential customers. The name recognition of a listing can also help secure better terms with potential lenders, provide an opportunity to display company culture and highlight a firm\u2019s unique qualities, and potentially help a company\u2019s sales and profits.\n*   **Creating a Second Currency**\u00a0\u2014The common stock of your firm can be used as equity instead of cash for acquisitions, attracting and compensating management, employees, directors and strategic partners. These funds can broaden a firm\u2019s potential for development and expansion, such as research and development, new equipment or to pay off costly debt.\n\nToday\u2019s capital markets present an array of opportunities for companies\u2014particularly smaller, emerging growth companies\u2013 looking to raise capital.

Human Imaging Company combines Smartphone Technology with Artificial Intelligence to track Fitness and predict Health Risks.\n\n29 November 2021\n\n**Fort Lauderdale, FL, November 29, 2021** \u2014 Exchange Listing, LLC announced that its client, Advanced Human Imaging (Advanced Human Imaging or \u201cThe Company\u201d), a rapidly growing medical technology company has commenced its listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) with American Depositary Receipts (\u201cADR\u2019s\u201d).

The pricing of the Company\u2019s U.S. initial public offering of 1,000,000 units is at a price to the public of US$10.50 per unit. Each unit issued in the offering consisted of two American Depositary Shares (\u201cADSs\u201d) and one warrant to purchase one ADS. Each ADS offered represents 7 ordinary shares of AHI. The warrants are exercisable immediately, and expires three years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of US$5.52 per ADS. The ADSs and warrants are immediately separable and were issued separately. Gross proceeds from the offering, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses, were approximately US$10.5 million.\n\nThe Company has granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to an additional 300,000 ADSs and/or up to an additional 150,000 warrants to purchase up to 150,000 ADSs at the public offering price, less underwriting discounts, and commissions.\u201cExchange Listing was instrumental in our achieving a listing on Nasdaq, the world\u2019s most prestigious platform for emerging growth companies,\u201d said Vlado Bosanac. \u201cTheir guidance and knowledge was immensely valuable throughout the early stages of this complex process. This important step for AHI will allow us to increase liquidity and gain exposure for the\n\nCompany with institutional and retail investors in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cClearly, Advanced Human Imaging has transformed a smartphone into a health risk assessment tool,\u201d said Peter Goldstein, CEO, Exchange Listing. \u201cThe Company\u2019s revolutionary technology can be used to assess and capture chronic disease risks or more simply track fitness goals in under one minute.

Developing a comprehensive roadmap and strategy is different for each company, and having one can ensure a smoother IPO execution. Proper IPO preparation and readiness is one of the critical elements for the commencement of life as a public company, which can be a memorable, gratifying and once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nA Micro-Cap Company may consider an initial public offering as a growth strategy for various reasons. Whether it be financing expansion, an exit strategy or recapitalization, an IPO may be an effective long-term strategy for early-stage Micro-Cap companies. However, the journey to executing an effective IPO requires a well-defined strategic road map.\u00a0\n\nThis involves detailed planning, experience, an appreciation of the unpredictable nature of the stock market, and an unwavering commitment to becoming a successful publicly listed company. Developing an IPO roadmap requires management to construct a business model, systems, and processes that can support credibility for investors. The IPO roadmap for a successful outcome will include an action plan, timeline, budget, communications, and team structure.\n\n*   **Listing Requirements** \u2013 Identifying the quantitative and qualitative requirements necessary and preparing and submitting exchange listing applications and related documentation.\n*   **General and Strategic** \u2013 The Company\u2019s operating philosophy and business model including each business line\u2019s growth strategies and objectives.\n*   **Finance** \u2013 Historical and projected financial results, including assumptions, operating performance, revenue, operating expenses, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), net income and earnings per share.\n*   **Management / Board of Directors** \u2013 The Company\u2019s management team and employees any pending or anticipated changes to key management, board composition, governance structures or corporate structure.\n*   **Valuation** \u2013 Valuation metrics including comparable company analysis,\u00a0 discounted cash flow analysis, current and precedent transactions analysis\u00a0\n*   **Legal, Regulatory and Risk Management** \u2013 Material disputes, litigation, claims, or possible claims pending or threatened against the Company.\u00a0\n*   **Corporate Communication** \u2013 Corporate Communications and Awareness Strategy, asset development, guidelines, and communication policies.\n*   **Environmental** \u2013 Appropriate licenses, permits, and approvals compliant in all material respects and policies to ensure the highest health, safety, and quality standards are met and maintained.\n\n**Listing Metrics**\u00a0\n\nA proper Roadmap for a Micro-Cap IPO will include a plan to satisfy the criteria\u00a0the company must satisfy in order to\u00a0list its common stock on an exchange. This is a critical element of understanding of the criteria including the financial requirements, the initial bid price, market value of listed securities, and market value of unrestricted publicly held shares as well as the corporate governance requirements needed to meet the exchange standards.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Putting the Puzzle Pieces in Place**\u00a0\n\nThink of these initial steps as throwing all the puzzle pieces out of a box, laying them out in front of you facing the right way up, and then putting them all together. The road map is the picture on the front of the puzzle box (which we can imagine is the Bell Ringing Day), and the steps ahead are the process of putting the puzzle pieces together. The IPO process and preparations are complex and consist of multiple steps and documentation.\u00a0\n\nBefore the IPO, the company must collect and deploy a great deal of data and documentation required to go public and be well scrutinized in the lead-up. For example, you\u2019ll need information relating to company finances, business plans, responses to information requests from lawyers, investment bankers, the auditors and the Exchange carrying out due diligence.\u00a0\n\nTo ensure you are keeping track of all the pieces of the puzzle,\u00a0 documentation and providing consistency and efficiency in this process, consider compiling an IPO data room. Best practices would include an administrative person dedicated to this process as a single communication point and responsible for collecting and organizing consistent financial and non-financial data.\n\n**Putting Together the Pre-IPO Team**\n\nEmbarking on a Micro-Cap IPO is a significant step in the overall development of a company and it will require a team with expertise and specialized knowledge.

Before embarking on the IPO journey, assembling a knowledgeable IPO team will be crucial. It can take longer than you might think to find the team members with specialized knowledge and experience to send a strong signal to the market about the company\u2019s leadership, business model and governance strength. This team will include advisors current with the IPO market, its requirements and existing relationships to make relevant introductions, selection and negotiation of investment bankers, lawyers, accountants, and other professionals and the Exchanges.\u00a0\n\nThe team and your board of directors will have a say in relevant company issues like corporate governance, employee stock option policies, determining executive compensation, etc. Therefore, we recommend starting to assemble your board of directors early.\u00a0\n\nBoth before and after the [IPO](https://emmiscap.com/) is complete, companies need to rely on their advisory team. Public companies will be subject to additional audits, quarterly reporting, investor and analyst updates, communication and awareness policies. Corporate governance and communication with investors take time and transparency and additional resources once the company is public.\n\nIndeed, the road to an IPO is challenging, but the right team can help firms find both the best partners and opportunities when they emerge.\u00a0\n\n_This post contains sponsored advertising content.

A micro-IPO is a unique funding opportunity for entrepreneurial companies to access capital and gain access to the public markets.\n\nMany entrepreneurs are not aware that even early-stage, pre-revenue companies from anywhere around the globe can raise capital and list on U.S. senior exchanges. Until recently, there was a belief that a company that wanted to go public needed a minimum of $100 million in revenue to attract an underwriter.
