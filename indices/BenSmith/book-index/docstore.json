I felt that I wanted to disconnect from \u2018life\u2019 to immerse myself in my spiritual practices without any distractions. Being self-employed makes it difficult to truly just stop, but this course would leave no room for anything other than deep inner exploration.\n\nThe course was full on. For 10 days we had to abide by \u2018Nobel silence\u2019, this meant for the entirety of the course nobody could talk or interact with anyone, in any way; not even a glance. There was a strict \u2018no phones or electronics\u2019 rule, so my phone was handed in on day 0, and I didn\u2019t see it again until day 11 (bliss!). We were woken up by a gong each morning at 4 am from our deep, meditation-induced sleep. The first 2-hour meditation of the day kicked off at 4:30 am. We were fed 2 vegan meals per day, the last one being at 11 am. Other than fruit at 5 pm, we would fast all the way through until the following day. Each day was virtually identical and was filled with around 10 hours per day of meditation, all of which were done either cross-legged on the floor or using a kneeling stool. For 3, 1-hour sessions per day, we had to adhere to \u2018adhittana\u2019 (strong determination), which meant for the full 1-hour meditation we weren\u2019t allowed to move or open our eyes at any time.\n\nI have been suffering from hip pain for several years and was conveniently diagnosed as having a \u2018hip impingement\u2019 and suspected cartilage tear the day before the course started. Hilariously, my doctor advised me to avoid certain activities/positions, one of them being sitting cross-legged on the floor! By this point, I was committed and just figured I\u2019d \u2018work it out\u2019 if the pain became too much. We also weren\u2019t allowed to exercise in any way other than a walk around the course gardens. When I say gardens, it was quite literally a bare field with some freshly planted trees.

My \ufb01ngers and eyelids began to \ufb02icker involuntarily and\n          suddenly an enormous surge of energy was released and\n          proceeded to pour around my body. It was beyond anything I had\n          ever felt in my life, a mixture of \u02bbenergy\u02bc and \u02bbelectricity\u02bc circulated\n          through me with such velocity. As this happened my consciousness\n          suddenly expanded, the rest of my body became \u02bbinvisible\u02bc and I\n          lost all body awareness. The consciousness I was experiencing\n          continued to expand and expand, the closest comparison I can\n          make was that it was as if I was travelling through space, but my\n          awareness was broadening. It was more real than our physical\n          reality, and I remember being struck at the sheer magnitude of\n          everything in this new plane of existence (new to me at least). I\n          could return to my body as and when I wanted within an instant,\n          which I did on and off, mostly to make sure I was still upright and\n          not choking on my saliva. If I came into my body too suddenly, I\n          would jolt, so it took a bit of practice to make it a smoother\n          transition. For the duration of this meditation, I continued to\n          experience this new realm, awe-struck at the sheer realness and\n          size of it all. It was nothing like a dream. At one point I tried to look\n          at myself, to see if I had a form - I didn\u02bct, I was clear colourless light.\n\n          When the meditation was over, I was buzzing In every sense of the\n          word. I walked the 300m from the meditation block to the toilets and\n          back again. My hands and arms felt invisible and energy was still\n          pouring off of me. I cannot express strongly enough how much\n          energy was coming off me. We had a 1-hour discourse to listen to\n          and then our \ufb01nal 45-minute meditation of the day. I wondered\n          whether the experience was a one-off or whether I\u02bcd be able to\n          leave my body again. When the meditation came around, I was able\n          to immediately leave again, this time without the initial surge of\n          energy, but still with the energy from before blasting through and\n          around me. Time as we know it in this physical plane didn\u02bct exist\n          when I was in the higher planes.
