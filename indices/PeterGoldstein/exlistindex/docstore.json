You become part of this unique community when going public as a micro-cap company.\n\n30 September 2022\n\n![](https://exchangelistingllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/shutterstock_1863564808.jpg.webp)\n\nA key component in the initial public offering (IPO) journey is finding the right investment bank and investment banking team in the micro-cap community. Going public and ultimately operating as a public company requires you to establish relationships with a group of specialized financial institutions with expertise in the micro-cap sector. You become part of this unique community when going public as a micro-cap company.\n\n## Selecting An Investment Bank\n\nSelecting the right investment bank and banker is critical to successfully structuring and executing your company\u2019s IPO. It is important to select an investment bank that focuses on micro-cap investors. These investors are different from small-, mid- or large-cap investors because market capitalization and investment thesis are more or less commensurate with a company\u2019s stage of business development. Investing in a micro-cap, mid-cap or large-cap company corresponds roughly to investors\u2019 risk-reward profiles.\n\nFinding the bank that fits your company best is not only about the size and sector in which you operate. It is also essential to consider the bank\u2019s history with transactions, experience and client successes; this can help to identify the right firm and individual banker. You want to choose the bank carefully; similarly, the lead banker should be the person you believe will champion your IPO and provide the specific attention and resources you need. Choose a lead banker with whom you can work well in the present and the future beyond your IPO; the bankers must have a good rapport with management for the long term.\n\nYou should also determine whether the lead underwriter will be the sole book runner and who will be responsible for coordinating and leading a well-organized underwriting syndicate. Finally, ask your prospective bank which banks they would likely form a syndicate with and what their distribution capabilities and strategies are.\n\nIt\u2019s common for a company to invite several banks to compete to win the rights to lead and manage that company\u2019s IPO.\n\n## The Investment Banking Team\n\nBankers for micro-cap IPOs generally provide the same services. They work with many of the same buy-side institutions that invest in micro-cap companies. They have trading desks servicing buy-side institutions, and they are in the business of selling stock.\n\nThe investment banking team will help you navigate the process of going public and negotiating to sell your new stock offering to investors. Naturally, this is critical to getting valuation right and will set the tone for your IPO. The investment bank you choose has a variety of purposes, including underwriting new stock issues, following on debt and equity financings, [mergers and acquisitions](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mergersandacquisitions.asp) and advising clients on strategic capital market matters.\n\nThe lead banker is an essential selection as this is the banking team member you will spend the most time with. This person will be an important asset to your team. As you\u2019ll discover, this person knows the market, how it is doing at any given moment and will represent you to get you the best valuation and opening price.\n\nWhen selecting the team, look at other IPOs they have recently completed and the valuation and performance of those deals immediately after pricing. The team and the people who work in sales and trading are the ones who will be interfacing with investors and need to believe in the company to be successful in selling the stock.\n\n## Do Your Homework\n\nIt is critical to do this homework before you get bankers involved. To do this, you can compare relatively simple metrics such as:\n\n*   Revenue\n*   Revenue growth\n*   Sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue\n*   General and administrative (G&A) as a percent of revenue\n*   Gross margins\n*   Operating margins\n\nUnderstanding these metrics will change how you see and operate your business and how it differs from your peer groups, apart from helping identify areas of opportunity and improvement. Once you have done this, you are ready to talk to bankers, and do not rush the process.\n\nHaving your historical and proforma financial model and the assumptions that drive the growth of your business and where the company is headed in the future is critical to developing before engaging bankers. In addition, building your list of a core group of three to five private and public companies comparison companies is essential.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5073, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "72eee941-5b42-4692-80dc-de2ef8eccbdb": {"__data__": {"id_": "72eee941-5b42-4692-80dc-de2ef8eccbdb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/selecting-the-right-investment-bankers-for-a-micro-cap-ipo/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/selecting-the-right-investment-bankers-for-a-micro-cap-ipo/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/selecting-the-right-investment-bankers-for-a-micro-cap-ipo/"}, "hash": "0c59c327b8c2c0a66882f83f69d22e44ae2b27f84e0e276c514be06f1d919c12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4eeaa832-6759-48e9-9d66-02f8cb3172a8", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/selecting-the-right-investment-bankers-for-a-micro-cap-ipo/"}, "hash": "5fddab1e9cd59001942f1316666f53534e3ac1bee5380b2f351f7600712d0a7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "## Do Your Homework\n\nIt is critical to do this homework before you get bankers involved.

Once you have done this, you are ready to talk to bankers, and do not rush the process.\n\nHaving your historical and proforma financial model and the assumptions that drive the growth of your business and where the company is headed in the future is critical to developing before engaging bankers. In addition, building your list of a core group of three to five private and public companies comparison companies is essential.\n\nThis list should be based upon a similar business model or a common industry segment in which you compete. Next, you should look at these companies for comparable valuations and identify your similarities and differences with your peer group. These metrics will be an essential and regular topic of discussion and analysis as you go through and beyond the IPO process. Then, compare your business model to those benchmark companies and determine what makes you unique.\n\n## Engaging The Bankers\n\nWhen you thoroughly understand your business and business model from a capital market perspective, it is time to engage the bankers. Once you\u2019ve identified banks, meeting with as many as possible is best to gain different perspectives on your IPO. You can expect a long relationship with the bank and the research department, so take your time finding the best fit.\n\nBeyond the IPO, it is normal to have at least a one-year contractual relationship with the bank, including a fee tail and right of first refusal. Again, the goal is to ensure that the sell-side research team truly understands your company\u2019s story, its history, where the business is headed in the future and its corporate culture.\n\nBegin this acclimation process as early as one year before the IPO.\n\n## Value-Added Propositions\n\nOne way investment bankers can further add value is by assisting in preparing and writing the business section of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registration. This section of the prospectus tells your company\u2019s story and will also contribute to the content of the pitch deck used for your investor roadshow.\n\nThe work of preparing the S-1 draft properly can save significant time and a lot of frustration leading to the IPO. Use the underwriter\u2019s experience with IPOs to review the S-1 for a more valuable and effective process.\n\nThe underwriter will also be instrumental in arriving at a valuation range of your company\u2019s offering, structuring your offering based on comparable companies, market intelligence and the banker\u2019s expertise. Keep in mind that the value-add of the bankers\u2019 capital market team is that they understand how their customers will react to specific language and visuals, which can be a massive help in this part of the process.\n\nThere are many important considerations when selecting the right investment bank. Remember, the bank\u2019s reputation within the micro-cap industry reflects on the company and should be factored into the decision.\n\nAs a final step, it is good practice to call a board meeting, present your case to the bank and banker you want to underwrite the IPO and hold a vote to have the board involved in the selection.\n\n_Featured image sourced from [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/good-deal-two-business-partners-shaking-1863564808)_\n\n_This post contains sponsored advertising content.

In addition, you will need to present your business model and how it will benefit from the IPO, show a pathway for investor return on investment, and include the following.\n\nThe basic rule of thumb for effective slide presentation goes like this: Less is more. So use fewer, more impactful words.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to consider other things when preparing your presentation, such as:\n\n*   Bigger is better. Minimum 18 font, 24 or larger preferred.\n*   Be visual. Use graphics to convey key data and/or concepts\n*   Go pro. Professional \u201cpolishing\u201d is highly recommended\n\nIntroduce your management team, what role each member plays and how they will contribute to the execution and growth of the company. Then, do dry runs with your team and the bankers to drill down on the nuances of the wording, the key messages, the timing, the effectiveness of examples, and the order of topics.\n\nRehearse, get to the point, know your numbers, convey confidence, and then rehearse again.\n\nThe Roadshow is a time-sensitive window before the IPO, where many discussions will occur with the SEC, the Exchange, and your bankers on various topics. During this time-sensitive window, the SEC will be reviewing your filing and provide comments and questions regarding your disclosures, your business, the risk factors, and for complete disclosure of material information.\n\nSimultaneously, the Exchange will review your application, provide comments, and ask questions regarding your application and meeting the quantitative and qualitative listing requirements. You will continue to work closely with your advisors during this time to help sort out the proper response in order to satisfy the SEC examiners.\n\nThe responses by the SEC examiners are critical to managing your timeline to IPO. The content you give to the SEC will be reviewed closely by third parties and live forever in the document you file publicly and ongoingly every quarter with the SEC.\n\n## Testing The Waters\n\nTesting the Waters (TTW) in the IPO process allows companies to gauge how successful investors receive their prospective IPO before committing to further time, expense, and scrutiny of a public offering of securities. This is especially true for an initial public offering by a company that is not already subject to public company reporting requirements.\n\nThe TTW of the capital markets allows for greater transparency and communication between the company and the investors before the full-blown IPO process and enables companies to adjust their strategy for the IPO. In addition, it allows investors to assess whether they want to invest.\n\nTTW periods are designed to help inform a management team and the underwriters about whether they should endeavor to raise capital from the public equity market before going through the actual process of going public.\n\nThe TTW roadshow allows management to meet with select investors to see how the opportunity is received and for underwriters to gain an indication of interest.\n\nThis process is valuable for management to see how investors react to you presenting and describing the business. In addition, you can gauge how the audience received the story.\n\nThis allows prospective investors to gain a significantly better understanding of the business and to refine your message after every presentation.\n\n## On The Road\n\nThe primary reason for the IPO Roadshow is to allow companies to generate enough interest from investors to raise the capital necessary to go from a private firm to a public one. In addition, it enables listing companies to understand their standing in the market.\n\nIf done successfully, IPO Roadshows can create an oversupply of capital to help drive a company\u2019s long-term success and accelerate its growth.\n\nScheduling and planning the Roadshow has changed since the pandemic and is primarily done virtually.

One of the many steps in the process of getting ready for an IPO, and one that is often overlooked and misunderstood is pre-IPO communication and awareness. A sound plan is driven by a communications and positioning approach that articulates a company\u2019s value proposition in a way that resonates with the investment community.\n\nManagement teams are typically trained to communicate to their buying audience, but will need to learn how to communicate and leverage thought leadership, product innovation and material business developments while the company is private, in order to raise awareness among key stakeholders and with the capital markets community well in advance of an eventual IPO.\n\n## Pre-IPO Marketing\n\nHigh-quality pre-IPO marketing is a critical phase in the IPO process, and possibly the most exhausting phase for the management team. It requires incredible attention to detail and dedication to getting the messaging just right.\n\nPre-IPO marketing is focused on the company\u2019s equity story, the management team and the development of usual and customary company communication and marketing practices.\n\nCompliant pre-IPO marketing, is focused on brand development and will not contain any forward-looking statements, plans, or predictions about the company\u2019s value or performance within regulatory requirements.\n\nDuring this time, the company will also begin collecting investor data for retargeting efforts that will begin at the time of listing.\n\nCompliant communication includes creating a standard for announcing milestones, key events, mandatory public company communications, business developments and successes.\n\n## The Investor Outreach program\n\nA strong investor outreach program will create investor awareness in preparation for when the company becomes listed. It will also hopefully attract a pipeline of potential investors pre-listing.\n\nThe investor outreach program from an internal perspective will help to prepare the company leadership team for the various communication requirements for the IPO and establish a protocol for compliant public company communication practices.\n\nIt will also allow the company management to gather contact information of interested investors and analysts for re-targeting after the company has gone public.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, it will define and refine the company\u2019s investor-focused story as well as the ideal target investor.\n\n## Preparation & High-Level Documentation\n\nDuring the Pre-IPO marketing period, the leadership team will meet to determine the current thinking on the company\u2019s purpose, equity story, go to market timeline and the key differentiators. This has likely been done from the company point of view, during this process it will be repositioned to address the investor\u2019s point of view. Management should also plan the iterative process to finalize how to move forward on those aspects.\n\nThe management team should begin identifyting the right tools for mapping all marketing efforts to create a high-level corporate purpose document and craft a Feeder Copy for marketing efforts.\n\nDuring this time, the company should also begin creating an assessment and inventory of all marketing supporting assets (such as logos, images and videos) as well as a shared folder where relevant parties can access these assets.\n\n## Regulatory Compliance\n\nBefore the public filing of a registration statement, the company should begin corporate marketing and start to establish the \u2018customary and usual\u2019 marketing efforts. They should create company \u2018visibility\u2019 with targeted investor communities by using digital marketing, influencers, publishing, social media and email or SMS campaigns.\n\nThis will provide an opportunity to capture investor/analyst contact information for retargeting efforts later.\n\nAfter the SEC Registration, the company should continue their customary and usual marketing, which will be focused on brand awareness and retargeting information. They will also continue to fine-tune marketing efforts (channel and positioning).\n\n## Post- IPO\n\nAfter the company has gone public through an IPO, it will want to pivot its marketing from generating awareness and seeking contacts to creating and seeking investors. This will require a tightly synced marketing strategy that has been outlined by an experienced Capital Market advisor and specialized agency.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5344, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ddbbf981-bea9-4909-9fb8-57fbb529ea63": {"__data__": {"id_": "ddbbf981-bea9-4909-9fb8-57fbb529ea63", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/pre-ipo-communication-and-awareness/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/pre-ipo-communication-and-awareness/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/pre-ipo-communication-and-awareness/"}, "hash": "62be87e7126a5bdc72f1669ab6008062884cadee1b596e70e5d3b793ab1ece67", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "437fdd6e-4a6b-4fd7-8422-de13fb585d9b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/pre-ipo-communication-and-awareness/"}, "hash": "8ddeaa12afa17a562db24e8e6c555c41f3da8d6c9d7c97bf374c54f7f555ca42", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "## Regulatory Compliance\n\nBefore the public filing of a registration statement, the company should begin corporate marketing and start to establish the \u2018customary and usual\u2019 marketing efforts.

As a public company, it\u2019s important to continually cultivate potential investors, research and analyst coverage. Additionally, the company will want to attract the optimal mix of investors to maximize liquidity and valuation.\n\nThe strategizing does not stop after listing. It is important to continue to create plans and timelines for expectations, milestones, key events and financing needs, all of which will benefit when supported by robust internal review and marketing campaigns.\n\nA great IPO advisory firm will help with these needs as well as product development roadmap milestones, M&A activities, expected timing for additional funding needs, closure of significant clients and an intellectual property roadmap.\n\nFor Post IPO market to have maximum returns on investment it is critical that the company has well packaged communication of their business accomplishments woven into the marketing activities.\n\n_This post contains sponsored advertising content.

Governance requires processes, systems and controls to ensure the effective and efficient use of resources for an organization to achieve its goals and objectives.\n\nSome may notice that countless startups and entrepreneurial companies have operated and succeeded with limited governance. This is especially prevalent in a founder-led company. The new requirements and transition to public company governance can be overwhelming for the management team, and implementing new procedures is time-consuming when reviews and approvals are required by outside parties, which can limit or slow entrepreneurial actions and cultures.\n\nIs it possible to get the corporate governance up to speed well before becoming a public company? It is! Setting up public company governance and a board of directors should ideally begin about one year before the [IPO](https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/ipos) date. Start by filling the two most important roles \u2014 the audit and compensation committee chairs \u2014 because they are required to operate as a public company.\n\nEach committee of the board has several procedures and processes to put in place, and it\u2019s best to have them processes in place with enough time to allow the committees to get settled in their roles and begin holding regular meetings as soon as possible.\n\n## The Corporate Governance Mindset\n\nIf done properly, good governance can help improve the effectiveness, efficiency and value of the company. However, implementing governance requires systems, controls and a proper mindset. Overseeing governance and corporate culture is time consuming, and adapting to the mindset of being a well-governed public company requires a commitment from leadership.\n\nThis shift in mindset often includes incorporating systems for third parties to assess and review your company and to affirm that corporate governance certification practices are in place before the [IPO](https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/ipos) date.\n\nGood governance also requires several tangible processes to be adopted by the CEO for the improved transparency that good governance provides.\n\nThese processes include:\n\n*   Accounting and compliant financial reporting\n*   Information technology systems and processes\n*   Board operations and decision making\n*   Timely disclosure of material information in compliance with Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) and exchange rules\n\n## Board Governance And Selection\n\nSelecting the best board members can be crucial to the success of the company. They may need specific skills and background to add serious value to the company. Large-cap expertise often doesn\u2019t exactly translate to the microcap ecosystem, so looking for those who are best suited to your company is often reccomended. As a company approaches an [IPO](https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/ipos) it may also be beneficial to recruit one or more directors with public company experience.\n\nEngaged and value-added board members are what every shareholder, officer and director should welcome. They also need the proper cultural fit and values to set the tone at the top of the company that, in turn, helps ensure proper governance throughout.\n\nBoard actions should include establishing ethical and operating standards and encouraging a commitment from the rest of the board members and the executive leadership. For board members, these standards are the baseline for being recruited to and remaining on the board and being affiliated with the company.\n\nEven CEOs who are highly attuned to corporate culture can have a limited understanding and experience of board governance. Among the attributes of proper board behavior should be independence and requisite experience and skills that will help the company determine both eligibilities for the board and to which committee each new director should be assigned.\n\nBoards can be a competitive advantage for the CEO and an asset for shareholders if they are properly implemented with the right people seated at the table.\n\n## Accounting And Financial Reporting\n\nGood financial accounting and reporting processes are the foundation of proper governance. This includes metrics and reports for compliance as well as managing company performance.\n\nThe process of implementing accounting, financial reporting and governance should not be an afterthought. It argubaly should be part of the foundation of your company \u2014 well before the IPO. This foundation starts with documenting each process in accounting, how account reconciliations occur and who reviews them.\n\nPutting these processes in place early in a rapidly growing company can prevent things from getting off track, which can often occur very fast.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5329, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66ef7f35-4ffd-4d97-b619-5028a7a1180b": {"__data__": {"id_": "66ef7f35-4ffd-4d97-b619-5028a7a1180b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/governance-for-a-micro-cap-ipo-what-does-it-look-like/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/governance-for-a-micro-cap-ipo-what-does-it-look-like/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/governance-for-a-micro-cap-ipo-what-does-it-look-like/"}, "hash": "70b99bc60ff4e0349e54bcf8ba5f90c798304dd9bd49b4cf7e1f0c6a53090026", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b46833d8-f910-4399-a9d2-c7186e26aba9", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/governance-for-a-micro-cap-ipo-what-does-it-look-like/"}, "hash": "5c43ebdc940592313692efb223f41f647864296f349a724a68644709d347e9bb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Among the attributes of proper board behavior should be independence and requisite experience and skills that will help the company determine both eligibilities for the board and to which committee each new director should be assigned.\n\nBoards can be a competitive advantage for the CEO and an asset for shareholders if they are properly implemented with the right people seated at the table.\n\n## Accounting And Financial Reporting\n\nGood financial accounting and reporting processes are the foundation of proper governance.

It argubaly should be part of the foundation of your company \u2014 well before the IPO. This foundation starts with documenting each process in accounting, how account reconciliations occur and who reviews them.\n\nPutting these processes in place early in a rapidly growing company can prevent things from getting off track, which can often occur very fast. The best approach to your IPO corporate governance is to set up the accounting and financial reporting from the beginning as if your company is already public.\n\nThe sooner you get these processes in place, the more time everyone has to adapt to the change. Every company, private and public, must make annual filings. Filings are required on a quarterly and annually for public companies.\n\nThe SEC sets prescribed deadlines, and adapting to filing on a specific timeline can end up being a big learning curve and challenge for micro-cap companies. This is where good governance applies, and with the right people, processes and alignment among the team, these filings can be better organized to be completed on time.\n\nHaving the right people to get accurate numbers promptly is the driver of the accounting and governance systems you must set up internally. Finding the right outside legal and audit support for compliance requirements and ensuring proper review will be a driving force of your company as a public entity.\n\nImplementing strong corporate governance practices can be incremental, and it usually starts with the leadership team. The new board and each committee should create and regularly review the relevant charters or terms of reference (TOR) and the board\u2019s policies. Carefully considered board governance is often a key piece of corporate oversight in the Micro-Cap sector. It is frequently an underappreciated part of the IPO process but if done thoughtfully can provide critical value to becoming a sustainable public company.\n\n_Image sourced from [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/image-illustration/large-yellow-signboard-on-metal-frame-1949618890)_\n\n_This post contains sponsored advertising content.

Look At These 13 Signs Of Legitimacy\n\n## It can be exciting to get in on the ground floor of a startup with big potential, but as the Theranos story has shown, it\u2019s essential to be wary of any hype and do your due diligence.\n\n23 May 2022\n\nIt can be exciting to get in on the ground floor of a startup with big potential, but as the [Theranos](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/020116/theranos-fallen-unicorn.asp) story has shown, it\u2019s essential to be wary of any hype and do your due diligence. Before investing in a startup, an investor needs to make sure that it\u2019s a legitimate business venture, created by the book, and that the founder can fully explain and back up the claims they\u2019re making about the potential of their product or service and their current financial situation.\n\nTo protect your money and interests, there are important factors to examine before investing in a startup\u2014even (or especially) one that\u2019s surrounded by a lot of hype. Below, 13 [Forbes Finance Council](https://councils.forbes.com/forbesfinancecouncil) members share the details a prospective investor should look at to ensure a \u201cpromising\u201d startup is legitimate.\n\n## 1\\. The Team\u2019s Skills\n\nWhile every investor would love to get in on the ground floor of a unicorn, they\u2019re called unicorns for a reason. So instead of hunting a mythical creature, investors should spend time getting to know the team to make sure they have the skills that match the company\u2019s current needs. If it\u2019s a startup, they need to be able to raise money and create. If it\u2019s a later stage, they need to be able to grow. \u2013 [Jeff Grobaski](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Jeff-Grobaski-Founder-CEO-Epic-River/2408f064-5454-4e3e-9c3e-fc3de4cf7323), [Epic River](https://epicriver.com/)\n\n## 2\\. The Founders\u2019 Track Record\n\nLooking at it from a venture capitalist view, you\u2019re investing in the founders. What\u2019s their track record? Do you get along with them? Is the team strong? What obstacles or difficult situations have they successfully navigated in the past that prove they\u2019re able to pivot and find a way? \u2013 [Randal McLeaird](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Randal-McLeaird-Managing-General-Partner-Ridgeline-Investment-Group/65b10079-d646-4a00-8294-40f92453ed1c), [Ridgeline Investment Group](https://www.ridgelineig.com/)\n\n## 3\\. The Energy Of The Business\n\nTrust your gut. What are your instincts about the founders? How passionate are they about getting their product(s) to market? What kind of energy do you feel when you walk into the business? Is there a subtle buzz of excitement? Are the employees talking to each other? Create an internal checklist that can alert you to red flags. These intangibles can speak volumes about a startup\u2019s legitimacy. \u2013 [Amanda Dixon](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Amanda-Dixon-Co-Founder-Barney/178f3e99-00c2-416f-8080-382a5a0f3152), [Barney](https://www.wearebarney.com/)\n\n## 4\\. The Leader\u2019s Internal Qualities\n\nEverything rises and falls on leadership. Ensure that the leader is beyond smart. Patrick Lencioni, author of The Ideal Team Player, says to look for people who are \u201chungry, humble and smart.\u201d Don\u2019t forget the \u201chumble\u201d part, as a lack of it has led to the demise of many great ideas and thought leaders. \u2013 [Darryl Lyons](https://councils.forbes.com/u/e0c13bf6-44a7-4be3-a30b-1a4d129e97cf), [PAX Financial Group, LLC](https://paxfinancialgroup.com/)\n\n## 5\\. The Company\u2019s Data\n\nLegitimacy (or a lack thereof) is often hiding in the company data. Look for what\u2019s actually happening with the company\u2019s products and services. Is there a real track record? Is the data logical and reliable? Is there a neutral third party who can ensure credibility?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3722, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f9304cb3-ae76-430d-9a99-8f9b0e9e405d": {"__data__": {"id_": "f9304cb3-ae76-430d-9a99-8f9b0e9e405d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/considering-a-startup-investment-look-at-these-13-signs-of-legitimacy/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/considering-a-startup-investment-look-at-these-13-signs-of-legitimacy/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/considering-a-startup-investment-look-at-these-13-signs-of-legitimacy/"}, "hash": "2ddf555401794cfce802b42a37f9719f0a0d99290cf0059146ade52984f8f881", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "b13fae5a-a12f-4420-83c3-e6c1b62af45e", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/considering-a-startup-investment-look-at-these-13-signs-of-legitimacy/"}, "hash": "0421ce28077b14f262858c0919a06d9d94aa3613af885ba3a9d8870cd13fd499", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "d28408b2-1e11-4cc1-9b57-2b0972d1fcdd", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d99dc5977e69409b0966182a9a0c23a3a3f77791db2b22eefb9127523f9d251b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Ensure that the leader is beyond smart.

The Market For The Startup\n\nA pitfall startups commonly encounter is overestimating the size of their market. Some niches and products are so single-minded that it\u2019s almost impossible to scale a business from a startup to a large company, even if the startup outperforms the competition. Thus, it cannot be overstated how critical a large and growing market is for startups. This will determine if your investment is a good one. \u2013 [Mara Garcia](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Mara-Garcia-CFO-Phonexa-Holdings-LLC/80b061fe-80f6-4feb-a327-7f0fb3713b8c), [Phonexa Holdings, LLC](https://phonexa.com/)\n\n## 7\\. The Weak Link\n\nIf you can\u2019t understand the weak link in the chain, pass. The Theranos story sounded great on paper, and the business model looked really attractive\u2014as long as the technology worked. But it didn\u2019t. The chain broke. Engineers and scientists can now tell us why it didn\u2019t work, but the risk was always there. An average investor probably could not have understood the technology. \u2013 [Todd Sixt](https://councils.forbes.com/u/6deb9ccb-cee3-4cce-a707-5316f0bff441), [Strait & Sound Wealth Management LLC](https://straitandsound.com/)\n\n## 8\\. The Startup\u2019s Management Team\n\nBefore investing in a startup, look at the startup\u2019s management team. What are the track records of the key players? Look for tangible results, and ask what their involvement is in the company. Look for a management team that is equally involved and that has demonstrated results. Think of it as hiring employees: Are these the people you want working for you? \u2013 [Jared Weitz](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Jared-Weitz-CEO-United-Capital-Source-Inc/894f31f2-64ae-4df7-974c-9f9474cb6d56), [United Capital Source Inc.](https://www.unitedcapitalsource.com/)\n\n## 9\\. The Company\u2019s Physical Operations\n\nDon\u2019t just accept pro forma numbers on a spreadsheet. If you\u2019re investing in a startup\u2014especially in a private placement situation\u2014it\u2019s a good idea to get eyes on the company\u2019s physical operations. Financials are easy to fake, but brick-and-mortar operations are harder to fabricate. \u2013 [Glenn Hopper](https://councils.forbes.com/u/dffeef30-bf4a-4002-b1e6-036fae6b71e5), [Sandline Global](https://sandlineglobal.com/)\n\n## 10\\. The Startup\u2019s Customers\n\nIt depends on what stage of the company you are investing in. If you are assuming the product actually works, make sure you talk to at least two active customers. During that conversation, get their honest feedback on the product and if they are planning on renewing and expanding their use. Also, make sure they are a true paying customer, paying full price. If not, you will get a skewed view.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3020, "end_char_idx": 6514, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d28408b2-1e11-4cc1-9b57-2b0972d1fcdd": {"__data__": {"id_": "d28408b2-1e11-4cc1-9b57-2b0972d1fcdd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/considering-a-startup-investment-look-at-these-13-signs-of-legitimacy/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/considering-a-startup-investment-look-at-these-13-signs-of-legitimacy/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/considering-a-startup-investment-look-at-these-13-signs-of-legitimacy/"}, "hash": "2ddf555401794cfce802b42a37f9719f0a0d99290cf0059146ade52984f8f881", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "f9304cb3-ae76-430d-9a99-8f9b0e9e405d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/considering-a-startup-investment-look-at-these-13-signs-of-legitimacy/"}, "hash": "c8d3fbac793a3de6b639618c0eb50cca4395b8a1966fa147ca2c163a1b4a9a39", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Financials are easy to fake, but brick-and-mortar operations are harder to fabricate. \u2013 [Glenn Hopper](https://councils.forbes.com/u/dffeef30-bf4a-4002-b1e6-036fae6b71e5), [Sandline Global](https://sandlineglobal.com/)\n\n## 10\\.

The Founder\u2019s And Leadership\u2019s Drive\n\nWhen investing in a startup, you are actually investing in the vision of the founder. The leadership team is second. Are they seasoned and ready to hit the door running? Or is this their first rodeo? The founder and the leadership team are what make a startup tick, so look for high EQ paired with the drive and gas to mold the vision. Projections are important, but the leadership to make it happen is even better. \u2013 [Cynthia Hemingway](https://councils.forbes.com/u/e938c665-fdb8-4e33-aaf9-293e83c537f0), [Fourlane, Inc.](https://www.fourlane.com/)\n\n## 12\\. The Company\u2019s Cash Flow\n\nInvestors should keep a close eye on how a company is handling its cash flow and check that the numbers look realistic. If an owner isn\u2019t properly collecting payment from their clients, is overextending themselves frequently or is underspending on important tools or research, then they might not be a good investment. \u2013 [Nick Chandi](https://councils.forbes.com/u/57d8ce8c-27a4-4b04-9c5c-c470337dad55), [ForwardAI](https://www.forwardai.com/)\n\n## 13\\. The Capital Invested To Date\n\nIt is important to know how much capital has been invested to date, along with who the prior and future potential investors are. The investors, the structure and the valuation are all critically important to the future of the enterprise.

Over two years after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent shift to remote work, experts are starting to see some of the financial implications of moving work out of the traditional office setting.\n\n12 August 2022\n\nWhat started out as a necessity has turned into a way of life for many: remote work. Over two years after the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent shift to remote work, experts are starting to see some of the financial implications of moving work out of the traditional office setting.\n\nWhile results are largely promising and several experts point to [various ways](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2021/10/14/how-remote-work-can-transform-your-finances/?sh=1284ae202446) remote work has helped businesses financially, the members of [Forbes Finance Council](https://councils.forbes.com/forbesfinancecouncil) have been observing both positive and negative financial trends among businesses newly engaged in remote work. Below, 14 of them share some key financial results they\u2019ve observed for companies that have switched to remote work and why these insights should matter to every business leader.\n\n## 1\\. Companies Are Paying Compliance Fines\n\nWhile financial implications are usually positive, we\u2019re actually seeing challenges caused by remote work\u2014specifically, around monitoring communications for compliance purposes. With the move to remote work, compliance staff were basically left blind as to what is going on in their organizations. Those organizations that didn\u2019t adapt fast enough are now receiving regulatory fines of $200 million and up. \u2013 [Shiran Weitzman](https://councils.forbes.com/u/c95fca14-8d1b-4484-b273-6587d9a86210), [Shield](https://www.shieldfc.com/)\n\n## 2\\. Companies Are Spending Money To Improve Communication Applications\n\nWhen an organization is considering remote work options, thought must be given to maximizing communication efforts. Before making the switch, measure the tradeoff. Yes, you are likely able to recognize cost savings in certain areas, but where do you need to spend to improve your communication applications to maintain efficiencies? \u2013 [Kacey Butcher](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Kacey-Butcher-Chief-Financial-Officer-Adaptation-Financial/5a53c5b3-0c22-413d-a8b6-090fdedac9e7), [Adaptation Financial](https://www.adaptfa.com/)\n\n## 3\\. Industries That Require In-Person Training Are Struggling To Maintain Productivity\n\nRemote work is not helpful or workable in a growing number of industries that require training younger employees to be experts in their fields. It\u2019s hard to train new lawyers and accountants on how to do their jobs if they can\u2019t work alongside someone and learn how it works. This lowers productivity and impedes the ability to replenish the workforce, which ultimately impacts profitability. \u2013 [John Ward](https://councils.forbes.com/u/3317a7e5-7afb-4471-a3bc-2edcbf0a28e9), [Bridge Investment Group](https://www.bridgeig.com/)\n\n## 4\\. Struggles With Customer Service Are Causing Some Companies To Lose Business\n\nWhile some companies have made the transition seamlessly, others have failed miserably. We have moved our bank accounts and our P&C brokers. Both are big names in their respective industries. It feels like there is a lack of supervision. I have waited days for a return call for basic services. Companies that can operate remotely and still provide excellent service thrive during this new period. \u2013 [Michael Seltzer](https://councils.forbes.com/u/31a0aaaa-f2ab-4651-abc2-4d88c96d4904), [V\u00e9rit\u00e9 Group, LLC](http://veritegroupllc.com/)\n\n## 5\\. Remote Work Culture Can Get Watered Down\n\nCulture is defined as the values, ideas, attitudes and goals that characterize a firm. Firms work extremely hard at developing a great culture.

There Are Hidden Costs In Maintaining A Strong Culture\n\nA fully remote business requires a strong company culture to ensure a sense of purpose and shared passion for your employees. While the overhead costs might be lower with a remote team, it is vital to consider the hidden costs of maintaining a strong culture while working remotely and investing in technological changes and employees\u2019 future prosperity, retraining and role in the community. \u2013 [Peter Goldstein](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Peter-Goldstein-CEO-Exchange-Listing-LLC/28205a1d-3adb-4824-b121-af8b73f90996), [Exchange Listing LLC](https://exchangelistingllc.com/)\n\n## 7\\. Managing A Multi-State Workforce Is Challenging\n\nRemote work is not for every company or role, and oversight is important. The biggest impact is the inability, especially in small businesses, to cope with a multi-state workforce. They are not equipped to manage multi-state systems for payroll and benefits and are struggling with remote people management. Seek help on regulatory and personnel management and development matters. \u2013 [David Kelley](https://councils.forbes.com/u/7e0b6dc8-afcb-489f-a335-78e9a321a31a), [Mailprotector](https://mailprotector.com/)\n\n## 8\\. Expenditures On Rent Can Be Significantly Reduced\n\nIf work is consistently completed in a timely manner, remote work could provide a potential windfall in expense savings for a business owner. Moving to smaller offices brings down rent costs, as does allowing employees to work from remote locations. In addition, employees saving commute time will be happy to have the flexibility and will feel motivated to be sure their work is done on time, efficiently and accurately. \u2013 [Christopher Drake](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Christopher-Drake-Managing-Partner-Drake-Consulting-Group-LLC/c5862441-7987-4215-b11e-b88034586a72), [Drake Consulting Group, LLC](http://www.drakeconsultinggroup.com/)\n\n## 9\\. Companies With Large Office Spaces Are Considering Leasing Or Selling\n\nWe might have switched to a \u201chybrid office,\u201d but in reality, we\u2019re only using about 20% of our office space. That\u2019s a huge financial responsibility for a space we aren\u2019t using to its full capacity anymore. Now, we\u2019re starting to ask ourselves if we should lease or sell our property.

Remote Work Can Add Complex Tax Implications\n\nA company can get a nasty surprise when its remote workers move to states the company wasn\u2019t registered in.

There\u2019s A Higher Risk Of Costly Data Breaches\n\nA data breach is one of the most significant financial risks that come with remote work. Remote offices still need to maintain data integrity and security, especially during periods of high employee turnover. Files are shared remotely and in different time zones. Confidentiality within a household can\u2019t be verified or secured. Companies that want to shift to remote work must set up data integrity systems first. \u2013 [Jared Weitz](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Jared-Weitz-CEO-United-Capital-Source-Inc/894f31f2-64ae-4df7-974c-9f9474cb6d56), [United Capital Source Inc.](https://www.unitedcapitalsource.com/)\n\n## 12\\. Businesses Are Investing More In Cybersecurity\n\nAlthough business leaders generally expect to cut operating costs by implementing a remote work environment, doing so does require additional investment to enhance cybersecurity measures. Before switching to a remote or hybrid work environment, business leaders and advisors alike must ensure that they have the right tools in place to secure their network while keeping costs in line. \u2013 [Mara Garcia](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Mara-Garcia-CFO-Phonexa-Holdings-LLC/80b061fe-80f6-4feb-a327-7f0fb3713b8c), [Phonexa Holdings, LLC](https://phonexa.com/)\n\n## 13\\. Companies Are Incurring New And Increased Tech Costs\n\nThere has been an increased investment in technology and process creation for operational efficiencies. Examples include internal and external communications SaaS products that were previously not present in our business, VOVO -1.5%IP phone systems, messaging systems, video conferencing software, shared digital document storage, and tech equipment, including laptops, headsets and high-speed internet. \u2013 [Cynthia Hemingway](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Cynthia-Hemingway-CFO-Fourlane-Inc/e938c665-fdb8-4e33-aaf9-293e83c537f0), [Fourlane, Inc.](https://www.fourlane.com/)\n\n## 14\\. Models For The Cost Value Of Production Are Changing\n\nManaging production and the cost value of production in a remote workforce is more difficult than it is within a controlled office environment. Efficiencies in a remote workforce are lower than those in a physical workforce, and this difference is greater within industries that require a high level of collaboration between co-workers.

Market conditions and individual business financials can change on a daily basis, and stakeholders need access to verified, fully updated financial reports to make the decisions most likely to encourage continued financial success or to correct course if needed.\n\n14 February 2022\n\nBusinesses depend on accuracy in their financial reporting, but ensuring that reports are timely is equally important. Market conditions and individual business financials can change on a daily basis, and stakeholders need access to verified, fully updated financial reports to make the decisions most likely to encourage continued financial success or to correct course if needed.\n\nFollowing best practices in financial reporting can ensure that even the busiest entrepreneurs have the information they need to make well-informed decisions. Below, nine Forbes Finance Council members share their top tips for accurate and timely financial reporting.\n\n## 1\\. Simplify By Identifying Truly Critical Information\n\nDetermine the documents you need to make data-driven decisions one, five, ten, and 15 days after the end of the month. Prioritize them accordingly. Then, simplify the deliverables to include the critical few pieces of information that you actually need. Do you really need that line-item P&L with 100 rows, or can you get by with a topline version that includes ten rows? \u2013 [Anthony Bahr](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Anthony-Bahr-Managing-Director-Strategex/46569fb9-727f-4928-8ed0-711d421bdbaf), [Strategex](https://strategex.com/)\n\n## 2\\. Leverage Collaborative Digital Tools\n\nTimely and accurate financial reporting can be a way to reduce business costs. Leveraging existing digital tools that automate tasks, such as tracking receipts and inventory management, can ease small-business operations. Many bookkeeping platforms can also sync with these tools, centralizing all your data and making timely financial reporting that much easier. \u2013 [Luz Urrutia](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Luz-Urrutia-Chief-Executive-Officer-Accion-Opportunity-Fund/2826b4c4-797e-403a-9f3a-a30d668e7a3f), [Accion Opportunity Fund](https://aofund.org/)\n\n## 3\\. Set Up A Calendar Of Events\n\nPreparing a schedule of activities and tasks with a calendar of events is paramount. A simple schedule becomes an important management tool. Get buy-in from the CFO, audit committee, auditors or other senior officers who have agreed to the timeline and clarified the scope of work and project parameters for preparing financial statements. This helps in creating team alignment and accountability. \u2013 [Peter Goldstein](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Peter-Goldstein-CEO-Exchange-Listing-LLC/28205a1d-3adb-4824-b121-af8b73f90996), [Exchange Listing LLC](https://exchangelistingllc.com/)\n\n## 4\\. Ensure Reports Are Tailored To Your Company And Industry\n\nYour financial statements should be tools that allow you to run the business and make decisions proactively. They should be reliable, timely (created within ten to 15 days of the end of each month), and tailored to your industry, stage of the company and goals for the future. They should compare you to others in your industry, provide benchmarks and report on key performance indicators. \u2013 [Leslie Heimer](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Leslie-Heimer-Real-Estate-Finance-Expert-MBA-American-Liberty-Mortgage-%7C-Stockworth/95040b38-b40d-4004-ad81-8d983db9f3cc), [American Liberty Mortgage | Stockworth](https://almortgagecorp.com/)\n\n## 5\\. Reconcile Transactions Throughout The Month\n\nOne way to deliver timely financial reports is to reconcile transactions consistently throughout the month. For example, you could track and record your operational transactions on a daily basis. Similarly, reconciling subsidiary and general ledgers each week can save considerable time at the end of the month. Additionally, one could use automation within technology to simplify this chore further.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4115, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9f717700-94cb-4866-8d79-36fc1185e427": {"__data__": {"id_": "9f717700-94cb-4866-8d79-36fc1185e427", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/9-smart-practices-to-ensure-accurate-timely-financial-reports/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/9-smart-practices-to-ensure-accurate-timely-financial-reports/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/9-smart-practices-to-ensure-accurate-timely-financial-reports/"}, "hash": "323bfc5c91a424d90b26dc3307451427cc1539f923c0f5a6c2bd46d078a1b49a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d5eda0ae-a78d-4928-b5c7-d64d34514a8f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/9-smart-practices-to-ensure-accurate-timely-financial-reports/"}, "hash": "5eba5af4e5c2146a03d3121414b1aa919d9ace0a15a39562119647d49511b782", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "They should compare you to others in your industry, provide benchmarks and report on key performance indicators. \u2013 [Leslie Heimer](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Leslie-Heimer-Real-Estate-Finance-Expert-MBA-American-Liberty-Mortgage-%7C-Stockworth/95040b38-b40d-4004-ad81-8d983db9f3cc), [American Liberty Mortgage | Stockworth](https://almortgagecorp.com/)\n\n## 5\\.

Implement A Delivery Schedule\n\nIn advance of the period end, build a very detailed close schedule so that everyone knows what they are supposed to deliver and when it is to be completed. Many reconciliations, schedules and entries can be completed prior to the end of the period, extending your resources. Reviewers should not wait until the end to review, either. Organization and prep work are important. \u2013 [David Kelley](https://councils.forbes.com/u/7e0b6dc8-afcb-489f-a335-78e9a321a31a), [Mailprotector](https://www.mailprotector.com/)\n\n## 7\\. Pull Data In Real Time\n\nI think it is most important to leverage the integrations and APIs built into software packages to pull data in real time and update it quickly for client-related pieces. The news cycle has compressed tremendously in the past ten years, and leveraging technology\u2014especially in the financial services world\u2014is mandatory to remain relevant and competitive in the marketplace. \u2013 [Dan Cupkovic](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Dan-Cupkovic-Director-Investments-ARGI-Financial-Group/02c8f072-3336-423c-a03b-aa2ce04d92d9), [ARGI Financial Group](https://argifinancialgroup.com/)\n\n## 8\\. Optimize Workflows For Flexibility\n\nIf the last few years have taught us anything, it is that we need data to make decisions immediately in our businesses. A lot of companies look at their financial reporting as primarily needed for tax purposes or board reviews and not as a tool for decision-making. Workflows and systems should support flexibility, and if they don\u2019t, it is time for new tech and process consultants. \u2013 [Marjorie Adams](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Marjorie-Adams-CEO-Fourlane/a6136573-ebc4-4dac-b4d3-9839f7ed6e5b), [Fourlane](https://www.fourlane.com/)\n\n## 9\\. Set Up Automated Financial Reports\n\nUtilize modern cloud software to access your accounting data and automate your financial reporting.

Employees may respond differently to a new leader and business sales or stocks may take a dip, depending on how influential the leader is.\n\n30 August 2022\n\nWhen a longtime leader or business owner is ready to step down from their current position, it can have a significant impact on a company. Employees may respond differently to a new leader and business sales or stocks may take a dip, depending on how influential the leader is.\n\nWhether it\u2019s a member of the C-suite, a longtime manager or the business owner themselves who\u2019s retiring, it\u2019s essential to have a solid plan in place before handing over the reins. Below, 14 members of [Forbes Finance Council](https://councils.forbes.com/forbesfinancecouncil) discuss the financial implications businesses must address when a significant leadership change is on the horizon.\n\n## 1\\. Replace Departing Leaders From Within\n\nYou must prepare to replace that leader in your company and have someone who\u2019s trained to step into that role. Promoting from within the company has been the best approach for us when losing a key member of our team. For our partners, we have key man insurance in case something happens to a person who is key to driving business revenue. Without preparation, you are preparing to fail! \u2013 [Joseph Lustberg](https://councils.forbes.com/u/dafe177e-a254-4f50-9447-c1faf1bc12ce), [Upwise Capital](https://upwisecapital.com/)\n\n## 2\\. Anticipate How The Change Will Affect Employees\n\nYour business must anticipate how the change will affect your employees. Prioritize your key employees and customize incentive plans to ensure the value drivers in your business remain satisfied with their positions throughout the leadership transition. A transition that leaves your key employees unhappy can be detrimental to the financial success of your business. \u2013 [Brian Slipka](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Brian-Slipka-CEO-True-North-Equity-Partners/aa234dbf-392b-4c10-8259-06bf1eea543c), [True North Equity Partners](https://www.truenorthequitypartners.com/)\n\n## 3\\. Consider The Owner\u2019s Effect On Cash Flow\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand the implication of the owner\u2019s effect on the cash flow forecast. Do they bring in new revenue with new clients? Do they run certain expenses through the business that would go away with their exit? Do they personally guarantee any of the credit lines for the business? \u2013 [Meredith Moore](https://councils.forbes.com/u/a8fcba3a-0edd-4017-93ae-a2cb12ae32d2), [Artisan Financial Strategies LLC](https://www.artisanfsonline.com/)\n\n## 4\\. Have A Plan For Maintaining Internal And External Relationships\n\nSmall companies are often direct reflections of the personality and ethos of their leaders. It is important to have a plan for maintaining both internal and external relationships when the leader steps down. A mismanaged transition could lead to customer or employee churn, which could have significant financial impacts. \u2013 [Glenn Hopper](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Glenn-Hopper-Chief-Financial-Officer-Sandline-Global/dffeef30-bf4a-4002-b1e6-036fae6b71e5), [Sandline Global](https://sandlineglobal.com/)\n\n## 5\\. Deepen Relationships With Key Accounts\n\nBeware of losing customers to longtime competitors. Deep relationships with key accounts need to be proactively nurtured when a key leader is exiting. Key leaders have maintained these customers for a long time, and those partners have likely been courted by the competition along the way. Competition often sees departing leadership as a \u201cland grab\u201d opportunity. Don\u2019t underestimate the power of relationships. \u2013 [Drew Gurley](https://councils.forbes.com/u/2c32d94b-dbfa-4964-ae7a-9d5ed68ca613), [Redbird Advisors](http://redbirdagents.com/)\n\n## 6\\.

Build A Long-Term Financial Model\n\nWhile a leadership change can be a significant upheaval, having a company with efficient financial systems leads to a smoother transition. Correct financial reporting, accounting practices and governance systems start with the leadership team, so make sure these foundations are set before a significant leadership change. A financial model for three, five and ten years out is a strong element in a succession plan. \u2013 [Peter Goldstein](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Peter-Goldstein-CEO-Exchange-Listing-LLC/28205a1d-3adb-4824-b121-af8b73f90996), [Exchange Listing LLC](https://exchangelistingllc.com/)\n\n## 7\\. Work With Advisors To Address Tax Implications\n\nIn many cases, the owner of the business is the major shareholder. This could cause a disaster in terms of taxes if there hasn\u2019t been careful planning. A team of advisors should be involved in this seemingly easy, but actually complicated, transition. There are solutions to avoid these problems, and in some cases, it could be the end of the business if they\u2019re not addressed. \u2013 [Christopher Drake](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Christopher-Drake-Managing-Partner-Drake-Consulting-Group-LLC/c5862441-7987-4215-b11e-b88034586a72), [Drake Consulting Group, LLC](http://www.drakeconsultinggroup.com/)\n\n## 8\\. Properly Calculate The Leader\u2019s Intrinsic Value\n\nWhen a business owner or key leader is ready to step down, a full understanding of their intrinsic value must be measured prior to the execution of the transition. If the reach of the departing leader\u2019s intrinsic value is incorrectly calculated, significant unplanned costs can occur through the impact of decreased productivity levels across a multitude of channels. \u2013 [Kacey Butcher](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Kacey-Butcher-Chief-Financial-Officer-Adaptation-Financial/5a53c5b3-0c22-413d-a8b6-090fdedac9e7), [Adaptation Financial](https://www.adaptfa.com/)\n\n## 9\\. Add Up The Costs To Cover Everything The Departing Leader Does\n\nHow much of the current customer base and general business development is the result of work by the owner or leader? It takes time and delicate maneuvering to foster and transfer relationships. You may end up needing a team of people to replace the owner, some for client management and others for business development. The commissions and salaries alone may end up dwarfing what the exiting leader costs. \u2013 [Aaron Spool](https://councils.forbes.com/u/018ec39e-d32e-40d9-a4bc-8c7758c1118b), [Eventus Advisory Group, LLC](https://eventusag.com/)\n\n## 10\\.

Ensure There\u2019s Buy-In For The Transfer Among Employees\n\nYour employee teams have a significant impact on your company\u2019s finances. Great teams generate the maximum return with the least amount of effort. You must be open and honest with them about the transition, creating buy-in before the transfer takes place. After all, it\u2019s your team members who will do much of the work to ensure the transition is as smooth as it can be. \u2013 [Justin Goodbread](https://councils.forbes.com/u/f9145b94-41ff-4da7-9a05-1152de60bc2f), [WealthSource Partners, LLC](https://www.wealthsource.com/)\n\n## 13\\. Safeguard Strategic Relationships\n\nLosing the leader could carry multiple costs: revenues, negotiated pricing, replacement compensation and key staff may all be impacted. Leaders are rainmakers, and as such, they are strategically connected to vendors, clients, partners and staff. Safeguard your strategic relationships. Take the time to forecast financial impacts to fully understand what the exit means moving forward. \u2013 [Cynthia Hemingway](https://councils.forbes.com/u/e938c665-fdb8-4e33-aaf9-293e83c537f0), [Fourlane, Inc.](https://www.fourlane.com/)\n\n## 14\\. Be Prepared For Employee Turnover\n\nLeadership changes can create chaos among employees that must be managed. Being transparent about leadership changes and anticipated company changes will minimize employee turnover. Employees are the cornerstone of any business, and incurring recruitment costs due to high employee turnover can hurt. Companies should expect turnover as employees devoted to original leadership retire or change jobs. \u2013 [Jared Weitz](https://councils.forbes.com/u/894f31f2-64ae-4df7-974c-9f9474cb6d56), [United Capital Source Inc.](https://www.unitedcapitalsource.com/)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6497, "end_char_idx": 9277, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fb4fa4bf-0d4a-4869-a7e7-3f53fe41dcaa": {"__data__": {"id_": "fb4fa4bf-0d4a-4869-a7e7-3f53fe41dcaa", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/life-sciences/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/life-sciences/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/life-sciences/"}, "hash": "57ec6608ecb3d3e361f148e9a632fd2aca5a637263e83f0a5c78c7cd1446399b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# Exchange Listing- What do we do\n\n## Life Sciences Overview\n\n## We help global emerging life sciences companies  \naccelerate their product vision, FDA approval  \nand post approval processes, market execution  \nand senior exchange listing aspirations.\n\n## What we look for:\n\n## Business type\n\n*   Revolutionary Science\n*   Client traction\n*   Patient Acceptance\n*   Endorsement\n\n## Business sectors\n\n*   Pharmaceuticals\n*   Devices\n*   Med-Info/Software\n*   Nutraceuticals\n\n## Our sweet spot\n\n*   Cap raise$ 15m \u2013 $ 100m\n*   Revenue$ pre \u2013 $ 100m _(pre-revenue in emerging industries)_\n*   Market cap$ 30m \u2013 $ 500m\n*   ExchangesNasdaq, NYSE, NEO\n\n## Our Life Sciences Team\n\n## Extensive life sciences business, capital formation, public market execution coupled with deep scientific expertise established through over 100 client engagements.\n\n![](https://exchangelistingllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Bob-300-website.png)\n\n## Bob Giordano\n\n## Managing Director, Life Sciences\n\n![](https://exchangelistingllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/EXL-BW-Profile-Images-18-1.png)\n\n## John N.

Determining your firm\u2019s value, organizing and compiling reporting documents and putting together an IPO advisory team\u2014which involves establishing relationships with auditors, investment bankers and lawyers\u2014are just some of the processes and challenges. Market shifts have made it possible for early-stage firms to access capital to reach long-term goals and increase visibility. It\u2019s also a superior exit strategy to selling one\u2019s company.\n\nWhen management decides to go the IPO route, the company will have to withstand outside scrutiny and analysis. The key is to construct a business model that investors believe in and the company can deliver. Over the years, I have provided counseling to numerous founders as they chose to go public through an initial offering of stock as part of the company\u2019s growth strategy.\n\n## Why Is An IPO An Option For Smaller Companies To Achieve Growth?\n\nNew acquisitions, improvements, expansion and providing capital to the firm\u2019s founders are just some of the reasons a company might need to raise funds. As a company contemplates this next phase of growth, organizations have several options\u2014debt, venture capital, private funding or an IPO.\n\nWhile initial offerings for smaller companies were previously limited, they are no longer restricted to larger, better-capitalized names. The current IPO opportunity for micro-cap companies\u2014defined by having a market capitalization of roughly $50 million to $300 million\u2014is optimal. In fact, as leaders have seen, the IPO market is now more accessible than ever for early-stage companies, providing value as well as necessary access to growth capital and human resources.\n\nWhether a firm is in its early stages of growth or is a mature company looking to attract a significant equity investment, an IPO may be the best way to provide access to capital. Companies in their early existence may focus on establishing their purpose and growth strategy and expand into new markets or territories. In either situation, an IPO can help acquire the right resources to operate effectively.\n\nThe speculation fury during the dot-com era gave way to the theory that micro-cap IPOs were too expensive and risky. Unfortunately, this myth and the poor reputation have unjustly followed micro-caps. While there are risks and costs associated with IPOs, the right strategy and team can help entrepreneurs access capital and go public early in their life cycle with a win-win scenario.\n\nOther options for growth may be limited. Debt is an option, but limited access and the cost of capital may not be attractive, particularly with rising interest rates. And while the speed and pace that venture capital funds provide can seem appealing, there is the possibility that the VC interests will conflict with existing management\u2019s long-term strategy.\n\n## The Shifting IPO Market\n\nMany IPO candidates are sitting it out, but small issuers have dominated the IPO calendar this year. Nine of this year\u2019s 15 IPOs have raised $50 million or less, with seven additional listings scheduled.\n\nLast year, 2021, was an outstanding one for IPOs, as more than double the number of companies went public than in 2020. It was in fact, by deal count, the busiest year. There were [397 IPOs with a raise of $142.4 billion](https://www.renaissancecapital.com/review/2021USReview_Public.pdf), which made it also the biggest year for proceeds ever.\n\nWider access to the IPO market has historically been limited to retail investors. However, these sometimes riskier assets also hold the possibility of higher price appreciation. As micro-cap firms list on senior exchanges, this creates a compelling investment opportunity.\n\nThrough an IPO, entrepreneurs can access this market segment, and retail investors are able to invest early in the high growth, previously only available to institutional investors.\n\nAn IPO can also provide a micro-cap with increased awareness and exposure, additional market share and even an exit strategy for a micro-cap company owner.\n\n## Discovering The Right Road Map For Your Micro-Cap Company\n\nAfter a firm has experienced market acceptance and growth, an option to consider is an initial offering of stock as part of the company\u2019s growth strategy. Whether it be funding for expansion, an exit strategy or recapitalizing, an IPO may be the next step. But this journey requires a strategic road map including systems and controls.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4937, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f4adce71-c012-43e2-976f-4a3a30c17025": {"__data__": {"id_": "f4adce71-c012-43e2-976f-4a3a30c17025", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-micro-cap-ipo-a-long-term-strategy-for-early-stage-companies-to-go-public/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-micro-cap-ipo-a-long-term-strategy-for-early-stage-companies-to-go-public/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-micro-cap-ipo-a-long-term-strategy-for-early-stage-companies-to-go-public/"}, "hash": "bb9e9f5b4222c0cdb2fe61a540068492616d8aa4c4b803683a9959595cea8e04", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "66252fec-1bad-4092-b9be-821bc6b66536", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-micro-cap-ipo-a-long-term-strategy-for-early-stage-companies-to-go-public/"}, "hash": "484b3f4ff3eb22d488bec9da6c8376553e566ff18c9cf3606a414e433c89cabb", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Wider access to the IPO market has historically been limited to retail investors.

Whether it be funding for expansion, an exit strategy or recapitalizing, an IPO may be the next step. But this journey requires a strategic road map including systems and controls.\n\nBeginning with the equity listing requirements, a knowledgeable IPO team that has been through the micro-cap IPO process before can help firms prepare a road map and make introductions to investment bankers, lawyers and accountants.\n\nIPO preparations consist of multiple steps and documentation. Communicating and developing the right messaging is critical. Companies may find they need to restructure operations and replace or recruit new key hires for the next stage of growth. An IPO requires an organization to stand up to outside scrutiny and analysis, and the key is to construct a business model that investors believe in and the company can deliver.\n\nA significant step in going public is choosing a board of directors. As I shared in a previous piece, board members should not only represent shareholders and set goals. They need to also take on management\u2019s particular interest in items like corporate governance, executing dividend and options policies, determining executive compensation and more.\n\nAfter the IPO has been completed, the work is just beginning, making it crucial for companies to continue to rely on their advisory team. Public companies must contend with audits, quarterly reporting and analyst updates. Corporate governance and effective communication with investors take time, and additional capital as a newly listed firm is visible to the world.\n\nThe best situated and competitive companies should be built on principles of sustainability and resiliency, as well as healthy corporate governance structures and practices. In my experience, the road to an IPO is challenging, but the right team can help firms find both the best partners and opportunities when they emerge.\n\nThe decision to embark on an IPO is a major step in the overall development of a company that requires expertise and knowledge. Through a public listing, micro-caps can gain access to capital and begin their capital markets journey.\n\n_The information provided here is not investment, tax or financial advice.

It will go a long way when you finally operate as a public company.\n\nMicro-cap investors operate within a community and often co-invest within the same network. Knowing your investors may prove helpful in the future as your micro-cap company matures and you need support in the future for strategic initiatives. Investors have different strategies, and it is crucial to know who you are inviting to take ownership of your company during the IPO.\n\n## Getting Investor Attention\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for a newly listed micro-cap company is gaining investor attention to purchase shares in the IPO and open marketplace. Unfortunately, many micro-cap companies do not prepare for investor awareness leading into the IPO nor do they have a plan to create visibility. This becomes especially difficult during the quiet period required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which starts when you publicly file your registration with the SEC.\n\nBefore going public, invest time getting to know potential investors at various investment banks and industry conferences that offer companies a chance to present their businesses and hold one-on-one meetings with potential investors.\n\nThe quiet period regulation restricts companies from doing undue promotions that may influence or condition the market and affect the opening price of your IPO. That said, there are several ways to work with investors before you go public to properly educate them on your story and the plans you have for the future. First, companies may create a customary and consistent way of marketing and promotion, which may be continued during the quiet period.\n\nCompanies should create a media and awareness campaign at least a year before the IPO and set a high standard of customary marketing to the public. Unfortunately, most companies fail to create this program, and upon entering the quiet period, they realize the need for the public\u2019s attention, only to find that the option is now closed.\n\n## Understanding Your Investors\n\nYour bankers will bring investors to the IPO and drive the distribution of IPO share allocations. You have a certain amount of influence on the allocations and a say in who gets to purchase your shares. Before pricing, it is essential to do your homework on the investors and understand whom you want and don\u2019t want in the IPO.\n\nMicro-cap investors often have high churn rates and tend to look for structured financing with common shares and warrants. Focus on understanding the investors\u2019 investment strategies and goals, especially those who show they were oriented around long-term holding periods.\n\nIdentify which investors may have high churn rates of selling their IPO shares early. You can conduct searches for high-quality investors globally by researching shareholders in your peer companies and tracking the size of their investments and their churn rate. This churn rate gives you some idea about how long they may hold your shares. Then, you can map that information to the time frame you have to achieve significant company milestones.\n\nGlobal investors are seeking investments in your company\u2019s story and growth prospects. When it comes time to price your IPO, provide higher allocation to investors who express a longer hold period and give the company time to mature. Look for investors who are open and honest about their investment strategy. You\u2019ll recognize them as the ones who want to understand your company story and your vision for creating long-term value.\n\nRecognizing that investors will come and go when you are a publicly traded company is important. Often the most challenging part of being a public company is dealing with the ongoing naysayers creating short-sell opportunities for themselves with no basis in reality. However, over time, you can see trends in the changes in your shareholder base and better understand the activity in your shareholder base.\n\n## Investor Relationships\n\nMaintaining ongoing investor relationships creates a strong foundation as a public company.

Often the most challenging part of being a public company is dealing with the ongoing naysayers creating short-sell opportunities for themselves with no basis in reality. However, over time, you can see trends in the changes in your shareholder base and better understand the activity in your shareholder base.\n\n## Investor Relationships\n\nMaintaining ongoing investor relationships creates a strong foundation as a public company. Communicate with your investors often and consistently to gain investor trust by being open and honest with them about your wins and challenges. Update your investors regularly and stay directly connected to them as much as possible. This takes consistent work to cultivate but forms the basis of a great relationship when done correctly.\n\nCommunicate the good news and, even more importantly, the bad news consistently to strengthen investor relationships. Creating trust and goodwill with your investors will pay dividends in the future. The investors you want to obtain your stock, of course, should have a long-term view of your story, and that story should manifest itself over the investment timelines of those investors.\n\n## Investor Volatility\n\nMany micro-cap investors represent themselves as long funds, which is where they will hold your IPO shares. But many of these same funds also maintain a hedge fund operation with short holding periods and short positions. A short position would occur when selling shares of your stock the investor does not own. Investors who sell short believe the price of the stock will decrease in value. If the price drops, they can buy the stock at a lower price and make a profit, which is a common practice. This volatility is part of the dynamic of becoming a publicly traded micro-cap company.\n\nTrading volatility can be expected after your IPO as your company has a limited number of shares in the market to fight off market manipulation. You can battle the volatility (to a degree) by working hard with your good investors to ensure they understand the company\u2019s real story and your growth strategies and performance. Unfortunately, very few micro-cap IPO investors will hold your stock long-term. So it\u2019s worth learning to accept and embrace the volatility of being a micro-cap public company as a part of the world you will live in post-IPO.\n\nDeveloping investor relations continues to be a strategically important function that signals market trust and confidence. IPO-bound companies that establish investor relations function well before their IPO and instill trust and confidence in that market. In turn, capital markets are more likely to reward the company with a higher valuation when its leader rings the bell and it functions as a public company.\n\nFeatured Photo By Oren Elbaz on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/Wf1opKy4iaI)\n\n_This post contains sponsored advertising content.

What\u2019s a capital gain? And what in the world is a short sale? Financial terms and acronyms are used by many people, from financial analysts who truly understand what these terms mean to pundits who may only think they know what they mean. But there\u2019s a lot of admitted confusion among the public at large about key financial terms and their significance.\n\nEveryday investors may not be entirely clear on the financial and investing terms regularly used by their advisors and in the media they consume, but they should be if they\u2019re going to make informed decisions. Below, 15 Forbes Finance Council members define commonly misunderstood terms and concepts in the finance world and explain why they\u2019re important.\n\n## 1\\. Compound Interest\n\nMany people know that when you invest, interest is added to your original investment amount (the \u201cprincipal\u201d). But what folks often don\u2019t know is that interest is also added to the full balance of your account. Over time, this compound interest can lead to significant financial growth, demonstrating why investing early\u2014regardless of how small the investment may be\u2014can lead to a big payoff. \u2013 [Anuj Nayar](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Anuj-Nayar-Financial-Health-Officer-Lending-Club/2bf5a849-6f13-4b11-b5da-acee1f8efe17), [Lending Club](https://www.lendingclub.com/)\n\n## 2\\. The Difference Between A Financial Advisor And An Investment Advisor\n\nEveryday investors need to understand the difference between a financial advisor and an investment advisor. Although both roles are regulated by the SEC, financial advisors are brokers who buy and sell securities for themselves or others. An investment advisor, on the other hand, provides advice, reports or analyses on investments. New investors in particular will benefit from knowing the difference. \u2013 [Mara Garcia](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Mara-Garcia-CFO-Phonexa-Holdings-LLC/80b061fe-80f6-4feb-a327-7f0fb3713b8c), [Phonexa Holdings, LLC](https://phonexa.com/)\n\n## 3\\. Stocks And Bonds\n\nA bond is a loan to a company and represents two contractual promises to the bondholder: the promise to be paid interest on a timely basis and the promise to be repaid when the loan matures. A stock represents an ownership interest in a company; there are no contractual promises to pay any of a company\u2019s cash flows to a stockholder. For this reason, stocks are riskier than bonds. \u2013 [Vincent Rossi](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Vincent-Rossi-President-%7C-Chief-Investment-Officer-Intelligent-Capitalworks/471dc068-4140-43b7-902b-b7583e93e133), [Intelligent Capitalworks](https://intelligentcapitalworks.com/)\n\n## 4\\. Risk-Adjusted Performance\n\nThe absolute most important concept every responsible investor has to understand is risk-adjusted performance. Risk is not a story; it\u2019s not a relationship; it\u2019s not a feeling. Risk is a number: it\u2019s the probability of loss weighted by the potential degree of that loss. To meaningfully evaluate any investment, you have to measure its expected return and its risk\u2014in other words, its risk-adjusted performance. \u2013 [Benjamin D. Summers](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Benjamin-D-Summers-Managing-Director-Adagio-Group/5594b735-7fe6-4761-8d42-a97b38417c1b), [Adagio Group](https://www.theadagiogroup.com/home)\n\n## 5\\.

ESG Investing\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance, or ESG, investing is a catch-all term for various investment approaches that incorporate ESG criteria\u2014and it\u2019s a term that is often misused. It\u2019s not enough for institutions to claim an ESG investing approach; they must also evaluate the frameworks they\u2019re using and how they\u2019re living up to them. These investments should support people, not just profit. \u2013 [Randell Leach](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Randell-Leach-CEO-Beneficial-State-Bank/51bd0673-2589-4a9a-bad6-8b3c5f170d9e), [Beneficial State Bank](https://www.beneficialstatebank.com/)\n\n## 6\\. The Network Effect\n\nThe network effect is the idea that the more users a product has, the more value it creates; hence, the value of the product itself continues increasing organically. Companies such as Etsy, Ticketmaster and Instacart are examples of the network effect in practice. The more makers, ticket sellers and grocery deliverers, the more product that is available to the end consumer, who thus has a better experience. \u2013 [Sean Cantwell](https://councils.forbes.com/profile/Sean-Cantwell-Managing-Partner-Volition-Capital/e5b7e81d-808b-4461-99e4-e6ad7a799d09), [Volition Capital](https://www.volitioncapital.com/)\n\n## 7\\. Cash Flow\n\nI often hear the term \u201ccash flow\u201d confused with \u201cappreciation.\u201d A retirement plan\u2019s ability to deliver sustainable cash flow may be the driving factor that helps someone cover their income shortfall on a month-to-month basis. More often than not, I will hear someone tell me their portfolio grew by 6%, and they think that is their \u201ccash flow.\u201d Dividends and interest are simply a source of cash flow. \u2013 [Keith Gebert](https://councils.forbes.com/u/064e9663-caaf-4c92-af71-0b771b7f245b), [RightBridge Financial Group](https://www.rightbridgefinancial.com/)\n\n## 8\\. Tax Planning\n\nTax planning is not standardized and custom-fitted for an accountant/attorney and their clientele. Do not just assume someone who is preparing taxes is a tax planner. You must also ask for more than just a tax projection (what you\u2019ll owe)! Ask for savings strategies. \u2013 [Jackie Meyer](https://councils.forbes.com/u/303a02c4-b269-4f0d-aff2-ffadad764b47), [Meyer Tax, The Concierge CPA Coach](https://www.meyertax.com/)\n\n## 9\\. Stock Split\n\nA stock split doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re going to instantly multiply your money. It\u2019s simply a way for companies to make their shares cheaper and potentially easier to afford. As an investor, a stock split doesn\u2019t affect the percentage of the company you own. You will own more shares at a lower price, and they will have the same dollar value as they did before the split. Don\u2019t mistake this move for free money. \u2013 [Bill Keen](https://councils.forbes.com/u/3920f124-45e5-45e8-b9c8-9ff75f1f5c99), [Keen Wealth Advisors](https://www.keenwealthadvisors.com/)\n\n## 10\\. Stock Price Versus Stock Valuation\n\nToo often, people think that the price of a stock is what makes it expensive (or not).

Dark Pools\n\nDark pools are private exchanges that enable the trading of huge block orders of stock between institutional market participants at a fixed price. They do not publicly show the transaction prior to execution. This prevents a huge order from being misinterpreted by a trader who sees it without context. The trade is reported after the market closes, and there is no price advantage over a \u201clit\u201d exchange. \u2013 [Ryan Pannell](https://councils.forbes.com/u/70153da8-bbc6-48b9-8a98-d60214282958), Kaiju Worldwide\n\n## 13\\. Volatility Versus Market Risk\n\nMany investors conflate volatility with market risk, but they are different. Volatility is the measure of a range of price movements of a stock from one point to another. Some stocks or markets are more volatile than others, but price fluctuations are normal. Market risk is the chance that a stock will lose value when the market declines. But unless you sell the stock, the loss is only on paper. \u2013 [Jonathan Dash](https://councils.forbes.com/u/dfbcb5df-f120-4f0a-8b3f-1b103a4c1387), [Dash Investments](https://www.dashinvestments.com/)\n\n## 14\\.

The\u00a0[global IPO market delivered](https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/2021/)\u00a02,682 IPOs and raised $608 billion. The largest IPO globally in 2021 was the $13.7 billion IPO of Rivian Automotive on NASDAQ. During 2022, the market saw a dramatic decline in IPOs after a year of incredible IPO growth. Despite this, micro-cap and small-cap companies continued to dominate the 2022 IPO market in the U.S.\n\nTo date,\u00a0[there have been 101 IPOs on the U.S. stock market in 2023](https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/2023/)\u00a0raising more than $60.9 billion. It\u2019s a huge amount of money and yet, this is -25.78% less than the same time in 2022, which had 136 IPOs by this date. As you say, the markets go up and down constantly. Companies now have a new host of considerations when it comes to choosing the right time to go public. In today\u2019s current economic climate, most entrepreneurs feel fearful going into this environment wondering, will it be a success? In order to go public, the company becomes very exposed to scrutiny, the costs are high, and the complexities are many. It is important to make the right choices to establish the best chances of success.\n\nAs the CEO of Exchange Listing, LLC which helps micro-cap and small-cap companies list on the senior USA stock exchanges like NYSE and Nasdaq, we have seen it all. In this environment, we advise companies to focus on what we call \u201cIPO readiness,\u201d so that a company can IPO as soon as market conditions are practical for their goals. Whether you are a company founder looking to take your business to the next level, an investor seeking to understand the risks and rewards of small-cap and micro-cap IPOs or a professional advisor helping clients navigate the\u00a0[IPO process](https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/5-things-you-need-to-know-before-taking-your-business-public/446624), here are the seven things to consider before going public:\n\n## 1\\. Get committed\n\nBe clear that this is a direction for you. If you\u2019re not sure, don\u2019t start getting on a roller coaster, because once you\u2019re on it, it\u2019s dangerous if you try to get off in the middle. It sounds exciting to take a company public, and it is. But the evolving landscape and fluctuations demanded along the way can derail you unless you are convinced this is the best course of action for the success and growth of the company.\n\n## 2\\. Prepare before taking action\n\nPreparation for a micro-cap or small-cap IPO needs to begin well before the IPO date. Ideally, a company should start assessment anywhere from 18-24 months before the actual IPO date.\u00a0[Going public](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-critical-considerations-before-taking-your-company-public/369090)\u00a0is gratifying, but it requires significant internal and external resources. In addition, the complexities, cross-functional participation and interdependencies of going public require effective management and a clear understanding of the content and process. Therefore, preparation and groundwork are critical to a smooth execution process. Brian Cox, the CEO of SurgePays Inc. which went public in November 2021, attested to the value of having brought Exchange Listing on early in the Nasdaq Uplisting process. The company was able to prepare for its IPO well in advance and ultimately was able to raise a total of $19.78 million.\n\n## 3\\. Ensure the right business model\n\nOne of the most fundamental criteria for success includes having a\u00a0[business model](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/4-effective-business-models-that-built-billion-dollar/315056)\u00a0best suited for the public markets. We ensure that a company will be ready to IPO from a regulatory position. Business IPO readiness requires the coherent articulation of the core elements of the business, which will be unique to the company in question. Generally, it will encompass critical areas such as the business\u2019s strategy, markets, products, sales, marketing, operations, financial statements and metrics. You need a company deck, a one- or two-page teaser and a comprehensive financial model.\n\n## 4\\.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4401, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9e817e9a-322c-42be-be16-28808dea8786": {"__data__": {"id_": "9e817e9a-322c-42be-be16-28808dea8786", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/how-to-prepare-a-company-to-go-public-in-a-volatile-market/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/how-to-prepare-a-company-to-go-public-in-a-volatile-market/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/how-to-prepare-a-company-to-go-public-in-a-volatile-market/"}, "hash": "03c4eada3a950d007e9783a8b48a5b3d1c32081a762f45de2a3d05fc4a8ca0c8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "45b1c47d-babc-495f-b2af-fa0b557b51a1", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/how-to-prepare-a-company-to-go-public-in-a-volatile-market/"}, "hash": "3696bac6de5b0dab719343e5b321dc994bdbb61ef7170fdda11caab5b0be521d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The company was able to prepare for its IPO well in advance and ultimately was able to raise a total of $19.78 million.\n\n## 3\\.

You need a company deck, a one- or two-page teaser and a comprehensive financial model.\n\n## 4\\. Tighten your organizational readiness\n\nFor private companies that are planning a micro-cap or small-cap IPO, a strong executive team and a\u00a0[board of directors](https://www.entrepreneur.com/starting-a-business/a-bad-board-of-directors-can-ruin-your-company-heres/308366) are critical. A well-positioned team will increase the value of the company and provide confidence to potential investors. The assembly of a management team, advisors and board, including the form and structure of management compensation, is critical. The management team, advisors and board need to be optimally aligned with the company\u2019s strategic objectives and public market expectations so that they can guide the company\u2019s operations successfully and provide public market reporting.\n\n## 5\\. Align with SEC compliance\n\nThe S-1 registration statement may sound unfamiliar. Preparing the S-1 registration statement involves the creation of a basic business description consistent with the SEC regulatory requirements. This involves a summarized explanation of the business, its customers, its competition and other information relevant to investors who want to make an informed investment decision regarding the company and its prospects. It includes business and financial information designed to inform prospective investors and outline all material business risks.\n\n## 6\\. Prepare for scrutiny\n\nWhile audits may sound scary, these are a mandatory part of the process of preparing for the IPO, and it\u2019s important to get the details right. Footnotes and schedules are required when compiling the company\u2019s\u00a0[financial statements](https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/a-visual-guide-to-financial-statements-for-your-business/295786)\u00a0to ensure that the company\u2019s financial reporting complies with industry standards. The footnotes also provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements are presented fairly, free from material misstatement, and thus can be relied upon by investors.\n\n## 7\\. Get your finances in order\n\nIf the company\u2019s financials have been sloppy, now is the time to track each detail and category to ensure confidence from investors and approval. Prepare two years of profit and loss,\u00a0[balance sheet](https://www.entrepreneur.com/money-finance/what-is-a-balance-sheet-and-why-does-your-business-need-one/441858), cash-flow statements, related footnotes and supporting schedules. It is vital to have your financials in order to present the most accurate and thorough picture of the company\u2019s health and the opportunity to the investors.\n\nAlthough the broader IPO market seems to be on pause due to less-than-ideal marketplace conditions, know that these market conditions are not here to stay, at least not forever. Companies that are considering an IPO would be wise to use the current pause period to hustle while they wait and prepare to become\u00a0[IPO ready](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-get-your-business-ipo-ready/373112). Thorough preparation requires that your company not only takes the proper steps and does the right things but also invests in the right partners, resources, technology tools and team. Taking these actions now will set you up for the best chance of success when the time is right to execute your first or next IPO.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3536, "end_char_idx": 7671, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "11bb4606-2c16-4165-a858-b22ceadb85e9": {"__data__": {"id_": "11bb4606-2c16-4165-a858-b22ceadb85e9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/listing-as-a-service/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/listing-as-a-service/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/listing-as-a-service/"}, "hash": "7fa6c4d5a5f8073c9463f6f737cb71c4de75ab19454e2c4c45d1430353e9864b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# Exchange Listing- What do we do\n\n## Listing-as-a-Service (LaaS)  \nOverview\n\n## Leveraging over 10 decades of experience, our team  \nhas advised numerous well-established enterprises on the  \nintricate and ever-evolving complexities of a senior exchange listing.\n\n## Five Core Deliverables\n\n## Management, oversight and leadership of fundamental execution imperatives.\n\n## Five Core Deliverables\n\n## Unique expertise deeply rooted  \nin our experience in the legal,  \ninvestment banking, market  \nmaking and regulatory disciplines.\n\n## Listing-as-a-Service (LaaS) Team\n\n## Deeply experienced execution team committed to your company's successful senior exchange listing and beyond.\n\n![](https://exchangelistingllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Natalie-New-small-.png)\n\n## Natalie Durbin\n\n## Strategic Partnerships &  \nBusiness Development\n\n![](https://exchangelistingllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Gregg-Website.png)\n\n## Gregg Jaclin\n\n## Managing Director,  \nIPO Execution\n\n![](https://exchangelistingllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Mickey-Freeman-300x300-1.png)\n\n## Mikhail Freeman\n\n## Capital Markets,  \nProject Manager\n\n![](https://exchangelistingllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/EXL_Colour-Logo_Plum-Background-1024x432.jpg)\n\n## Subscribe to  \nour newsletter", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1272, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7cbaf13b-08bd-48b7-a825-21b62dc5b00c": {"__data__": {"id_": "7cbaf13b-08bd-48b7-a825-21b62dc5b00c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/metrics-beyond-money-heres-what-you-must-focus-on-to-achieve-true-entrepreneurial-success/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/metrics-beyond-money-heres-what-you-must-focus-on-to-achieve-true-entrepreneurial-success/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/metrics-beyond-money-heres-what-you-must-focus-on-to-achieve-true-entrepreneurial-success/"}, "hash": "81e09eb9add027467259c343a8419b246b1f4312bb03eaf4c2bf7dbe1f2247b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "9fb04628-2c1e-46ad-a365-ae99255d0b0a", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "cab80ddede48a1c65c00cd5946168e1c519c1a63cde4ea5c397d4cc52925cc4d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# Metrics Beyond Money \u2014 Here's What You Must Focus on to Achieve True Entrepreneurial Success\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nIn my 35-year career spanning pivotal roles, including CEO, chairman, investment banker, founder, board member and investor, I\u2019ve learned firsthand about entrepreneurial triumphs, where [success](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/unleashing-the-power-of-purpose-key-ingredients-for-success/463835)\u00a0is often measured by financial milestones.\n\nMy experiences in orchestrating successful IPOs, financings and M&A transactions have shaped my perspective on what it truly means to succeed, which I continually redefine as I evolve over the years \u2014 an insight I\u2019m eager to share with fellow entrepreneurs and CEOs.\n\n## Understanding entrepreneurial success\n\nEmbarking on the entrepreneurial journey is a profound expedition, transcending\u00a0[traditional notions](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/6-immeasurable-metrics-that-define-business-success/463581)\u00a0of success. Beyond financial metrics, success involves nuanced and evolving concepts \u2014 leadership, personal satisfaction and a sustainable vision. Success is not just about revenue growth, profitability and KPIs, or about how much money you earn, the valuation of your business or your perceived popularity. Rather it\u2019s about a journey beyond balance sheets \u2014 embracing fulfillment and impact that weaves through your entrepreneurial career.\n\n## Metrics beyond money: Measuring success holistically\n\nIn the pursuit of\u00a0[entrepreneurial excellence](https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-za/leadership/3-keys-to-entrepreneurial-success/332662), success must transcend traditional metrics, extending into areas like customer satisfaction, team culture and personal growth. As a globally embedded entrepreneur, I\u2019ve come to understand these non-financial metrics as pillars supporting a comprehensive and sustainable definition of success.\n\nShifting from a transaction-driven to a value-driven approach can profoundly transform the entrepreneurial landscape. For me, this shift has meant prioritizing long-term strategic actions with clients and stakeholders over short-term financial gains. Instead of focusing solely on immediate profitability, I evaluate success based on sustained growth, innovation and ethical standards. This approach not only enhances my brand reputation and integrity but also ensures a more significant and lasting impact. By adopting this value-driven perspective, success becomes a more meaningful pursuit, aligning with deeper business ethics and long-term vision.\n\nSimilarly,\u00a0[team culture](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/how-to-build-the-right-culture-by-building-the-right-team/442137), another success metric often overlooked, is the heartbeat of any successful venture. Leading your team through the shift from CEO to industry expert and mentor involves guiding them with your accumulated wisdom, fostering an environment of continual learning, and encouraging them to innovate and think strategically. Personal growth, as an entrepreneur and leader, is a compass guiding the entrepreneurial journey and must form the foundation of your pursuits. A CEO with no desire for personal growth and merely seeking financial success is a vacuum. In contrast, the deep desire for personal growth is not only a professional evolution but a personal one marked by continuous learning, adaptability and unwavering commitment to growth.\n\nIt\u2019s time for entrepreneurs to begin viewing success as a dynamic journey. The entrepreneur\u2019s role is to foster an environment where success means more than financial metrics. By prioritizing this holistic approach, an entrepreneur not only elevates their achievements but also inspires those around them to embrace a broader, more enriching definition of success.\n\n## The journey from knowledge to wisdom in entrepreneurship\n\nNo entrepreneur, CEO or industry expert starts their journey with a wealth of knowledge. Rather, knowledge accumulation comes from experience and often also from hardship. Knowledge, experience and hardship act as the building blocks for success. It\u2019s like assembling a toolkit, each piece representing industry insights, market trends and business intricacies. The phase of building industry knowledge and experience is instrumental in providing entrepreneurs with the necessary foundation for informed decisions and strategic plans.\n\nHowever, the crux of entrepreneurial prowess lies in the journey from\u00a0[knowledge to wisdom](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-steps-to-turning-experience-and-failure-into-wisdom/339463). Knowledge, in this context, is possessing the right answers \u2014 the foundational understanding of business dynamics. Wisdom transcends knowledge; it\u2019s the art of asking the right questions, sharing lessons learned and delving deeper into the complexities of entrepreneurial success and failure.\n\nWisdom within entrepreneurship is a dynamic process, involving not just knowing facts but applying knowledge and experience to reflect profound understanding and foresight. It\u2019s a shift from rote application to strategic insight \u2014 a transition defining an entrepreneur\u2019s evolution from novice to seasoned leader.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5249, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9fb04628-2c1e-46ad-a365-ae99255d0b0a": {"__data__": {"id_": "9fb04628-2c1e-46ad-a365-ae99255d0b0a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/metrics-beyond-money-heres-what-you-must-focus-on-to-achieve-true-entrepreneurial-success/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/metrics-beyond-money-heres-what-you-must-focus-on-to-achieve-true-entrepreneurial-success/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/metrics-beyond-money-heres-what-you-must-focus-on-to-achieve-true-entrepreneurial-success/"}, "hash": "81e09eb9add027467259c343a8419b246b1f4312bb03eaf4c2bf7dbe1f2247b4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "7cbaf13b-08bd-48b7-a825-21b62dc5b00c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/metrics-beyond-money-heres-what-you-must-focus-on-to-achieve-true-entrepreneurial-success/"}, "hash": "5a021fec9e48aeb8aa11217f9224b3fb40227e6ad9583ef781e30859516ef900", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The phase of building industry knowledge and experience is instrumental in providing entrepreneurs with the necessary foundation for informed decisions and strategic plans.\n\nHowever, the crux of entrepreneurial prowess lies in the journey from\u00a0[knowledge to wisdom](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/5-steps-to-turning-experience-and-failure-into-wisdom/339463).

It\u2019s a shift from rote application to strategic insight \u2014 a transition defining an entrepreneur\u2019s evolution from novice to seasoned leader. It\u2019s about understanding the\u00a0_why_\u00a0behind the\u00a0_what,_\u00a0steering clear of one-size-fits-all approaches and embracing a dynamic mindset for\u00a0[sustainable success](https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-ae/growth-strategies/how-to-ensure-your-business-enjoys-long-lasting-success/288772).\n\n## Crafting your wisdom: A self-mentoring blueprint\n\nFor entrepreneurs seeking to foster wisdom, actionable advice is paramount, and\u00a0[self-reflection](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/why-self-reflection-and-self-awareness-are-vital-skills-for/447154) is a crucial tool. I have also found that mentorship acts as a guiding beacon, offering diverse perspectives that enrich decision-making. The pursuit of wisdom in entrepreneurship must be deliberate and strategic, and it must invite a structured self-assessment process.\n\nSo, how can this be achieved?\n\n*   **Reflective evaluation**: Initiating the self-mentoring journey begins with a reflective evaluation. Entrepreneurs must engage in a thoughtful examination of their decision-making and\u00a0[problem-solving skills](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/what-smart-entrepreneurs-know-about-problem-solving/313089), asking targeted questions focusing on the effectiveness of past decisions and lessons derived.\n    \n*   **Establishing insight goals:**\u00a0Differentiating goals that deepen understanding from those expanding knowledge is critical. Insight goals should aim at developing a nuanced perspective and foresight, shifting from accumulating knowledge to establishing goals that contribute to cultivating insights.\n    \n*   **Active application:**\u00a0Entrepreneurs are encouraged to actively apply their understanding through real-world challenges. This hands-on approach tests comprehension and allows for refining knowledge into actionable insights, contributing to overall wisdom development.\n    \n*   **Embracing calculated risks:**\u00a0Wisdom often emerges from well-considered risks. Entrepreneurs are urged to embrace\u00a0[calculated risks](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/entrepreneurship-is-a-game-of-calculated-risk/277330)\u00a0as part of the self-mentoring blueprint, involving a careful evaluation of potential outcomes, encouraging them to step out of their comfort zones strategically and expanding understanding.\n    \n*   **Mentorship dynamics:**\u00a0Central to the self-mentoring blueprint is seeking mentorship and engaging in mentorship roles. Entrepreneurs are advised to actively seek guidance from experienced mentors while contributing insights to others. This reciprocal exchange fosters an environment conducive to wisdom cultivation, enriching understanding through diverse perspectives.\n    \n*   **Progress indicators:**\u00a0In the journey toward wisdom, tangible indicators are crucial for tracking progress. Entrepreneurs are encouraged to document key decisions and their impacts, offering a tangible way to measure the transformative transition from knowledge to wisdom.\n    \n\n## The journey ahead\n\nIn navigating the dynamic landscape of entrepreneurship and redefining success, I invite fellow entrepreneurs to connect and share insights. The entrepreneurial community holds a reservoir of\u00a0[diverse experiences](https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-in/entrepreneurs/heres-how-we-can-excel-in-work-by-adopting-the/317188)\u00a0and perspectives, offering the opportunity to redefine success resonating with each entrepreneur\u2019s core values and aspirations.\n\nSuccess, in its redefined form, becomes a tapestry woven with the threads of varied experiences, shared insights and a commitment to a profound understanding of entrepreneurial triumph. Beyond the balance sheet, we can forge a path leading to holistic and enduring success \u2014 one resonating not just in the boardroom but in the essence of our entrepreneurial endeavors.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 4274, "end_char_idx": 9023, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7b50669-f931-48e7-966e-29373e0e6686": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7b50669-f931-48e7-966e-29373e0e6686", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/criteria-exchange-listing/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/criteria-exchange-listing/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/criteria-exchange-listing/"}, "hash": "ecda662c6556cc14025d7ae17763f73812f63e1d3f7d9782d4d99c9b66b50a48", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# Criteria - Exchange Listings\n\n## Ideal company characteristics\n\n## We are selective with our deals to  \nmatch our experience, skill sets, and  \ncapital market relationships.\n\n## What we look for:\n\n## Business type\n\n*   Emerging growth and industry\n*   Business transformation\n*   M&A/Roll-up\n\n## Business sectors\n\n*   Technology in health and finance\n*   Sustainability, EV, and psychedelics\n*   Any catalyst with demonstrable execution\n\n## Our sweet spot\n\n*   Cap raise$ 15m \u2013 $ 100m\n*   Revenue$ pre \u2013 $ 100m  \n    _(pre-revenue in emerging industries)_\n*   Market cap$ 30m \u2013 $ 500m\n*   ExchangesNasdaq, NYSE, Cboe\n\n## Let\u2019s get started!\n\nOur process is fast, friendly, and simple and we would be excited to connect to explore  \nif we might be able to help you accelerate your business public market objectives.\n\n## Sign the mutual NDA\n\nTHIS MUTUAL NONDISCLOSURE AGREEMENT (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) is effective as of \\[DATE\\] between Exchange Listing LLC , headquartered at 515 E Las Olas Boulevard, Suite 120, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33301, and \\[NAME\\], \\[ADDRESS\\]. **Purpose.** Together we (\u201cDiscloser\u201d and \u201cRecipient\u201d) intend to discuss an opportunity (the \u201cOpportunity\u201d), which may include disclosure of Confidential Information. **Confidential Information** is information disclosed in any form that Discloser tells Recipient to keep confidential, including copies of such information.

A well-positioned team can increase the value of the company and provide confidence to potential investors.\n\n16 May 2022\n\n_This post contains sponsored advertising content. This content is for informational purposes only and not intended to be investing advice._\n\nFor private companies that are planning a micro-cap initial public offering (IPO), a strong executive team and board of directors will be critical. A well-positioned team can increase the value of the company and provide confidence to potential investors.\n\nThe right combination of skills, experience and strategic thinking will be needed, so it is crucial to understand the role each person plays. Teams do not always operate effectively while trying to cover a shortfall in personnel or leadership, and leaving a key role or area uncovered might show up in the company\u2019s performance going forward.\n\n## Company Culture\n\nThe pre-IPO stage of building a team is a unique opportunity to further shape the company\u2019s culture and develop a strong foundation to guide the company\u2019s growth.\n\nHiring for cultural fit is a critical factor to consider because company success can often be fuelled by attracting and hiring candidates who willingly share knowledge, ideas and experience to fit the company\u2019s personality.\n\nGiving priority to people who fit your company\u2019s culture can be key, and adapting best practices they\u2019ve learned elsewhere to benefit your company can be an added benefit. As you build a team, you also need to encourage new people to think differently about their roles and contributions to the company culture.\n\nLook not only for the basic breadth of knowledge, technical skills and demonstrated problem\u00ad-solving skills but also for great interpersonal skills.\n\n## The Board Members\n\nWhen choosing board members pre-IPO, taking the time to selectively choose substantive members who can help shape the board for success could be powerful for success. Look for board members who have relevant financing expertise. While experience in a large-cap company can seem attractive, it may not translate into smaller company expertise. Individuals with knowledge of micro- to mid-cap financing can be vital when the company is looking for new or additional funding.\n\nYou may also want to ensure board members have an industry track record. Consider the board member\u2019s experience \u2014 is it relevant to your industry? It can be crucial to have board members, especially for micro- to mid-cap companies, who are able to leverage their prior industry experience and provide counsel to emerging-growth firms.\n\nBoard members should have experience in public companies and corporate governance. Selecting board members who have a performance history with other public companies or experience with environmental, social and governance (ESG) policies can be incredibly helpful.\n\nFinally, consider fully supportive board members. Look for those who share a personal belief in your company\u2019s business model and management team.\n\n## The Finance Team\n\nEstablishing a solid finance team and accounting practices will arguably be essential to your success as a public company. In most early stage companies, the finance team has been hired to focus on basic bookkeeping.\n\nHowever, as you prepare for the IPO, you likely will need to build your finance team to transition to a public company and meet the increased demands of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting requirements. You might need to look at building the processes and systems necessary for scale.\n\nUnfortunately, and too often, rebuilding your finance team is not a simple matter of replacing old employees as it requires a variety of skills to sort out the past accounting issues and set the stage to meet SEC financial reporting requirements.\n\n## Overlooked Hires? \u2013 Pre IPO Marketing\n\nYour marketing department will evolve with your business as it becomes public, which requires a different type of marketing talent to communicate your story to the financial community.\n\nDeveloping and maintaining a persuasive and compelling equity growth story, as well as your management team\u2019s credibility, is a unique skill and typically goes beyond traditional marketing.\n\nThe marketing department\u2019s task is to communicate these changes to the marketplace in a consistent manner with a timely and well-thought-out approach. The key to all of this is change, adaptation and evolution to maintain a constant assessment of your company\u2019s awareness in the market, positioning and brand building.\n\nHigh-quality pre-IPO marketing can be an important phase in the IPO process \u2014 and possibly the most exhausting phase for the management team.\n\n## Legal\n\nAn in-house general counsel can be a great hire to help lead the way through the SEC filings and all the new agreements that come with going public.\n\nHaving the right general counsel on the executive team who has SEC knowledge, understands contract law and is an excellent negotiator can end up saving time, providing efficiencies and reassuring key stakeholders and investors.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5222, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d89085e2-4bd4-469d-aa53-2b1a07494e30": {"__data__": {"id_": "d89085e2-4bd4-469d-aa53-2b1a07494e30", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-team-for-a-micro-cap-ipo/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-team-for-a-micro-cap-ipo/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-team-for-a-micro-cap-ipo/"}, "hash": "e18bede35e7263796fb659bbd811779ca5c0b656318cbf93584668d7aa138060", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "9e03f238-1989-44c5-bc52-c263f1dd329d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-team-for-a-micro-cap-ipo/"}, "hash": "b2094cd9697aa9f3fc9bfc2eff51029f88247294cf0cec0e3ef8a4175841964b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Developing and maintaining a persuasive and compelling equity growth story, as well as your management team\u2019s credibility, is a unique skill and typically goes beyond traditional marketing.\n\nThe marketing department\u2019s task is to communicate these changes to the marketplace in a consistent manner with a timely and well-thought-out approach.

As a company grows, it will require new skills and different experience from all its employees, so it should not be surprising that a company will undergo turnover at various levels.\n\nYou can mitigate the damage of a bad hire by continually recruiting and looking for better people, either inside or outside the company. If your business is always growing, you will always be hiring. Start developing recruiting processes early and identify specialized recruiters who can assist your efforts.\n\n## Find the Dream Team\n\nTry to put together your dream team, rather than a team you need to force to fit into your company. The IPO process requires a well-oiled machine, and this will require a team of individuals who can work together for the success of the company. Ultimately, the changes the company will go through can be significant, and it will likely need a strong, knowledgeable team to guide the process.\n\n_This post contains sponsored advertising content.

This content is for informational purposes only and not intended to be investing advice._\n\n## Outlining the Road Map for Your Micro-Cap Company\n\nFor both new and experienced Micro-cap officers and directors, embarking on an IPO can be somewhat intimidating especially given the complexity and lack of check-boxed guidelines for Micro-Cap IPO strategies. Developing a comprehensive roadmap and strategy is different for each company, and having one can ensure a smoother IPO execution. Proper IPO preparation and readiness is one of the critical elements for the commencement of life as a public company, which can be a memorable, gratifying and once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nA Micro-Cap Company may consider an initial public offering as a growth strategy for various reasons. Whether it be financing expansion, an exit strategy or recapitalization, an IPO may be an effective long-term strategy for early-stage Micro-Cap companies. However, the journey to executing an effective IPO requires a well-defined strategic road map.\n\nThis involves detailed planning, experience, an appreciation of the unpredictable nature of the stock market, and an unwavering commitment to becoming a successful publicly listed company. Developing an IPO roadmap requires management to construct a business model, systems, and processes that can support credibility for investors. The IPO roadmap for a successful outcome will include an action plan, timeline, budget, communications, and team structure.\n\n**Listing Requirements** \u2013 Identifying the quantitative and qualitative requirements necessary and preparing and submitting exchange listing applications and related documentation.\n\n**General and Strategic** \u2013 The Company\u2019s operating philosophy and business model including each business line\u2019s growth strategies and objectives.\n\n**Finance** \u2013 Historical and projected financial results, including assumptions, operating performance, revenue, operating expenses, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), net income and earnings per share.\n\n**Management / Board of Directors** \u2013 The Company\u2019s management team and employees any pending or anticipated changes to key management, board composition, governance structures or corporate structure.\n\n**Valuation** \u2013 Valuation metrics including comparable company analysis, discounted cash flow analysis, current and precedent transactions analysis\n\n**Legal, Regulatory and Risk Management** \u2013 Material disputes, litigation, claims, or possible claims pending or threatened against the Company.\n\n**Corporate Communication** \u2013 Corporate Communications and Awareness Strategy, asset development, guidelines, and communication policies.\n\n**Environmental** \u2013 Appropriate licenses, permits, and approvals compliant in all material respects and policies to ensure the highest health, safety, and quality standards are met and maintained.\n\n## Listing Metrics\n\nA proper Roadmap for a Micro-Cap IPO will include a plan to satisfy the criteria the company must satisfy in order to list its common stock on an exchange. This is a critical element of understanding of the criteria including the financial requirements, the initial bid price, market value of listed securities, and market value of unrestricted publicly held shares as well as the corporate governance requirements needed to meet the exchange standards.\n\n## Putting the Puzzle Pieces in Place\n\nThink of these initial steps as throwing all the puzzle pieces out of a box, laying them out in front of you facing the right way up, and then putting them all together. The road map is the picture on the front of the puzzle box (which we can imagine is the Bell Ringing Day), and the steps ahead are the process of putting the puzzle pieces together. The IPO process and preparations are complex and consist of multiple steps and documentation.\n\nBefore the IPO, the company must collect and deploy a great deal of data and documentation required to go public and be well scrutinized in the lead-up. For example, you\u2019ll need information relating to company finances, business plans, responses to information requests from lawyers, investment bankers, the auditors and the Exchange carrying out due diligence.\n\nTo ensure you are keeping track of all the pieces of the puzzle, documentation and providing consistency and efficiency in this process, consider compiling an IPO data room. Best practices would include an administrative person dedicated to this process as a single communication point and responsible for collecting and organizing consistent financial and non-financial data.\n\n## Putting Together the Pre-IPO Team\n\nEmbarking on a Micro-Cap IPO is a significant step in the overall development of a company and it will require a team with expertise and specialized knowledge.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 5279, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "94240dab-21af-4012-afbf-e2415fdb6cf0": {"__data__": {"id_": "94240dab-21af-4012-afbf-e2415fdb6cf0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/roadmap-strategy-set-for-a-micro-cap-ipo/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/roadmap-strategy-set-for-a-micro-cap-ipo/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/roadmap-strategy-set-for-a-micro-cap-ipo/"}, "hash": "4195cb561de61a9e8756f943576703e265fa9c9322a409345f2533ea0b321e1c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "8406294c-7ee7-4ba0-8c7f-aacbdccbd597", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/roadmap-strategy-set-for-a-micro-cap-ipo/"}, "hash": "d31aadfdb25f18414722dfbcbd964414d79cb25f75f54b738e66e67f3f4d806b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The IPO process and preparations are complex and consist of multiple steps and documentation.\n\nBefore the IPO, the company must collect and deploy a great deal of data and documentation required to go public and be well scrutinized in the lead-up.

Best practices would include an administrative person dedicated to this process as a single communication point and responsible for collecting and organizing consistent financial and non-financial data.\n\n## Putting Together the Pre-IPO Team\n\nEmbarking on a Micro-Cap IPO is a significant step in the overall development of a company and it will require a team with expertise and specialized knowledge. Before embarking on the IPO journey, assembling a knowledgeable IPO team will be crucial. It can take longer than you might think to find the team members with specialized knowledge and experience to send a strong signal to the market about the company\u2019s leadership, business model and governance strength. This team will include advisors current with the IPO market, its requirements and existing relationships to make relevant introductions, selection and negotiation of investment bankers, lawyers, accountants, and other professionals and the Exchanges.\n\nThe team and your board of directors will have a say in relevant company issues like corporate governance, employee stock option policies, determining executive compensation, etc. Therefore, we recommend starting to assemble your board of directors early.\n\nBoth before and after the IPO is complete, companies need to rely on their advisory team. Public companies will be subject to additional audits, quarterly reporting, investor and analyst updates, communication and awareness policies. Corporate governance and communication with investors take time and transparency and additional resources once the company is public.\n\nIndeed, the road to an IPO is challenging, but the right team can help firms find both the best partners and opportunities when they emerge.\n\n_This post contains sponsored advertising content.

Perhaps the most well-known and anticipated way to raise capital is through the IPO process. Last year saw a record number of IPOS with 1,058 compared to a total of 480 for 2020.\n\nAs these traditional forms of funding capture the world\u2019s attention, a vastly underappreciated form, the micro-IPO, often takes a back seat. Yet, the micro-IPO represents a potentially great opportunity and a massive shift in the capital markets space, particularly for companies with a market capitalization between $50 million and $300 million (or micro-cap). A micro-IPO is a unique funding opportunity for entrepreneurial companies to access capital and gain access to the public markets.\n\nMany entrepreneurs are not aware that even early-stage, pre-revenue companies from anywhere around the globe can raise capital and list on U.S. senior exchanges. Until recently, there was a belief that a company that wanted to go public needed a minimum of $100 million in revenue to attract an underwriter. Now, accepting the additional risk, investors can directly access potentially high-growth companies, and entrepreneurs have a clear path into internationally recognized capital markets.\n\n## Shifts in the IPO Market\n\nA development-stage or emerging-growth company listing on a senior exchange can be a significant investment opportunity for a wide range of companies and investors. It also offers a chance for unmatched stock appreciation and added job creation and economic stimulus as the company grows. Similarly, by listing on a senior exchange, a broader range of investors can invest in public companies and participate in their growth and wealth creation.\n\nWhile everyone wants to invest in the next unicorn, these companies are mostly owned by large institutional shareholders, which limits the smaller retail investors.\n\nUnlike unicorns with market values of more than $1 billion, microcaps can provide an excellent opportunity for entrepreneurs to reap the rewards of publicly listing their stocks and a significant benefit for early investors. This is especially true for smaller, high-growth companies like those in emerging industries.\n\nCapital markets are seeing a flow of public money, which means investors are willing to risk investing in newer or early-stage companies, betting that the company could become the next big thing. As a result, micro-cap, publicly traded companies are going public sooner than they have ever been able to.\n\nThese are just a few of the potential advantages of micro-IPOs:\n\n*   Creates more capital-raising opportunities and financing options, typically at a higher valuation and a lower cost of capital\n*   Establishes a value for the company\u2019s securities and creates a public market for them\n*   Increases liquidity for existing and future investors and provides an exit strategy for venture and institutional investors\n*   Increases legitimacy and visibility which may, in turn, generate greater interest and awareness of the company\n*   Creates a second currency with the company\u2019s common stock, allowing the use of that equity instead of cash for acquisitions and attracting and compensating management, employees, directors, and strategic partners.\n*   Gives investors who want to get in early on the high-growth phase of a company access that previously was available exclusively to venture capitalists and private equity firms\n\nAs the prerequisites to enter the stock market continue to change, knowing what micro-IPOs are could provide both investors and entrepreneurs an edge in the market.\n\n## Why Some Are Considering Micro-IPOs\n\nIn some ways, an IPO can be a superior exit strategy to selling your company.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4915, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e4a0f45-ad33-412b-a5ce-4cd4f74e831d": {"__data__": {"id_": "3e4a0f45-ad33-412b-a5ce-4cd4f74e831d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-entrepreneurs-decision-to-go-public-with-a-micro-cap-ipo/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-entrepreneurs-decision-to-go-public-with-a-micro-cap-ipo/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-entrepreneurs-decision-to-go-public-with-a-micro-cap-ipo/"}, "hash": "a905e74d44acc5b5d87277c4bad176cf1985c48e3c1d7f9ec3b2257327f8bebf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "0ff709f5-e118-41f6-b220-ff1ce5d62906", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-entrepreneurs-decision-to-go-public-with-a-micro-cap-ipo/"}, "hash": "b6b819d86597eda2b99aa80645764ecc0849dc57b21bb5f2750e8c582d6b78dc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "*   Gives investors who want to get in early on the high-growth phase of a company access that previously was available exclusively to venture capitalists and private equity firms\n\nAs the prerequisites to enter the stock market continue to change, knowing what micro-IPOs are could provide both investors and entrepreneurs an edge in the market.\n\n## Why Some Are Considering Micro-IPOs\n\nIn some ways, an IPO can be a superior exit strategy to selling your company.\n\nWhen selling a company, you run the risk of losing the very thing you worked hard to create. A venture capitalist may not share the same ideals as you do, especially when their primary concern is a return on their investment.\n\nIn contrast, an IPO allows you to retain management control of your company and continue to choose how you want to manage it along with board oversight.\n\nListing on a Senior Stock Exchange and going through the IPO processes is an excellent opportunity for entrepreneurial growth companies to access capital and enter capital markets. A micro-IPO is more accessible than ever before, and is a valuable and essential vehicle to access growth capital.\n\nThere\u2019s been a return to the high volume of IPOs seen during the dot-com era of the 1990s. However, after the dot-com bust, the Wall Street myth that small IPOs are too expensive and risky became widely accepted. During the dot-com bust, the notion that a small company should not take on the risk or burden of the costs, obligations and potential liability of an IPO became commonplace. This myth, perpetuated over the past 20 years, has created a barrier to entry at a considerable cost to entrepreneurs, investors and the world.\n\nAn IPO is perhaps more within reach than you might imagine and could be a significant way for your company to grow, access capital and gain market share.\n\nThe next installment of this monthly articles series will discuss how to access a micro-IPO and how to prepare for one.\n\n_This post contains sponsored advertising content.

This content is for informational purposes only and not intended to be investing advice._\n\nPreparation for a micro-cap initial public offering ([IPO](https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/ipos)) begins well before the IPO date. Ideally, a company begins assessment anywhere from 18 to 24 months before the actual IPO date.\n\nGoing public is a gratifying process, but it requires significant internal and external resources. The complexities, cross-functional participation and interdependencies of going public require effective management and a clear understanding of the content and process. Preparation and groundwork are critical to the smooth execution process.\n\nThe assessment process, which is arguably often underappreciated, is critical to positioning a company for going public. Starting and understanding the assessment process as early as possible and implementing in parallel to assembling the team and resources required in this process is essential.\n\n## The Analysis Of Readiness\n\nA company\u2019s business model determines how it should be run and presented to investors. It can be vital to build your business model with clear assumptions and milestones and use those metrics to measure your company\u2019s progress. For those who are thinking about going public, there is a need to assess your business model. Know where your company is today and get some clarity on where you need to be in one, three, five years to drive the vision and valuation of your company in a public market.\n\nAs part of the assessment process, some of the most critical people will be those who can carry out the ongoing changes and improvements of the business. Usually, the operating numbers and projections flow through them, so they will often be the first to identify issues emerging across the company.\n\nIt\u2019s crucial to develop a strategy to anticipate current revenue growth. During the assessment process, figure out the transition timing for key roles and have these transitions occur pre-[IPO](https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/ipos) so the changes are implemented before that critical time.\n\n## The Assessment Process\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that you cannot run a business if you do not know where you are headed, and you cannot resource your business correctly unless you know how it is performing. One of the ways to understand how your company is performing is to compare it to a peer group. Carefully select several peer group companies and evaluate your company\u2019s performance according to those competitors.\n\nSome of the areas of focus you should focus on include:\n\n*   Demonstrating to investors how you are performing against your peer group where investors are concerned.\n*   Understanding how the market will value your company and the measures it will use, including revenue, net income earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) or other metrics.\n*   Looking to cash-flow growth as a valuation metric regardless of your business. Either free cash flow (FCF), including the capital and spending, or operating cash flow (OCF). Assessing the quality of the company\u2019s employees and professionals and building for the future.\n\nA critical part of this process is putting the [IPO](https://www.benzinga.com/calendars/ipos) team into place. This team will bear the brunt of the work to prepare the company to go public and keep the process going post-IPO. The chief financial officer is a key member of a company going public and needs to understand the capabilities of the finance and legal team and hire team members who will help to grow the business. In addition, finance members need a technical understanding of accounting internal controls and have a solid fundamental knowledge of accounting principles.\n\nYou also want to include a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reporting specialist who understands SEC and generally accepted accounting principles requirements and can communicate with management, auditors and the board of directors.\n\n## Preparing For Future Growth\n\nThe goal of the assessment phase is to get as complete a picture as possible of the company and the supporting professionals you will depend upon as you start down the IPO path. Identify as early as possible the weaknesses and systemic problems that will need to be addressed over the next 12 to 24 months.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4862, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1f068407-0994-4fb3-b123-0cfa29f83c26": {"__data__": {"id_": "1f068407-0994-4fb3-b123-0cfa29f83c26", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-analysis-and-preparation-for-a-micro-cap-ipo-thinking-about-going-public/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-analysis-and-preparation-for-a-micro-cap-ipo-thinking-about-going-public/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-analysis-and-preparation-for-a-micro-cap-ipo-thinking-about-going-public/"}, "hash": "06fb1b8ccf93e1d411cebfdca7053a077ac86e28e31566c240551d5114e76f7d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "11ff7731-f53b-42b0-8dac-293bc36208a0", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/the-analysis-and-preparation-for-a-micro-cap-ipo-thinking-about-going-public/"}, "hash": "fd86768361f2ae51c2f74a963fbec512edae91734dc6cc434ec31c835abe6257", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "This team will bear the brunt of the work to prepare the company to go public and keep the process going post-IPO.

Identify as early as possible the weaknesses and systemic problems that will need to be addressed over the next 12 to 24 months.\n\nAssess the current state of the company\u2019s information systems and what it will cost to bring those systems up to public company-grade to adequately run the business through the coming years of growth. Determine whether system upgrades and implementation are needed to provide data and enterprise resource planning systems for development and scaling.\n\nIn preparing to go public, you must share the current and future of your systems with management and the board and get buy-in for implementation company wide. Then, as changes begin to occur, assess the company culture, and determine whether the executive team and board of directors have the mindset to grow, change and adapt to being public.\n\n## Dig Deep\n\nDo your due diligence during the assessment and take the time to understand your company\u2019s issues, including pending liabilities, C-suite and board of director backgrounds, human resources and employee issues, and help develop a strategy for dealing with related specific topics.\n\nAssess the current auditors to establish whether they are qualified to provide reports under public company guidelines. Be aware that any material weakness or significant deficiencies will impact the company\u2019s valuation and disclosure requirements. It is crucial to determine what it will take to make your company compliant with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) and create a plan to fix roadblocks to regulatory approval, which can take over a year to sort out.\n\n## Too Much?\n\nDon\u2019t worry if this sounds like too much. One of the easiest ways to prepare for an IPO is to consider hiring a capital market adviser, who can help you with the following:\n\n*   Listing strategy: Develop a listing strategy with key stakeholders, the executive management team and the board of directors. Once a clearly defined strategy is in place, they will manage the process and provide enhanced transparency and accountability.\n*   Corporate governance: As you move forward with the public listing, you need to develop an independent board and committees. A capital market adviser can assist you in setting up the board and committees and work with you on corporate charters that are acceptable to The Nasdaq Stock Market.\n*   Capital market resources: Introduce the company to the best class of service providers, including investment bankers, investor relations firms, legal counsel, accounting, auditing, transfer agent and Edgar agent to deploy solutions more effectively and best use your internal resources.\n*   Project Management: Ongoing project monitoring and management throughout the public listing process is essential. As key milestones are hit and the timeline progresses, they manage the working group, including your investment banker, attorneys and auditors, to streamline the IPO process. This includes weekly calls or meetings and management of the S-1 Registration Statement filing and comment process.\n\nCreating an achievable IPO plan for completion is vital. Commencing the execution as a private company will help you stay on track and meet key IPO objectives, such as maximizing IPO price and attracting a high-quality investor base. The next installment will outline the IPO roadmap and strategy for going public.\n\n_This post contains sponsored advertising content.

It\u2019s not a matter of if, but when, and how you navigate the unknown that defines your journey. Once you learn to accept uncertainty, entrepreneurs and CEOs will discover that it can be a gateway to transformative growth.\n\nRecognizing the inevitability of uncertainty is a strategic imperative. I have learned that it is not a challenge to overcome; but instead, something to be embraced as a tool for leadership and a catalyst for personal growth.\n\nAs an entrepreneur and capital market expert with over 35 years of experience, I lost almost everything I had built during the Great Recession. It was a period that tested more than my business acumen; it was a profound examination of my resilience and integrity. During that time, the challenges were immense, but in retrospect, the lessons were invaluable. The strategies I learned to employ, the decisions I made and the mindset I cultivated during that tumultuous time continue to be guiding beacons for me in navigating the complexities of today\u2019s business environment. Having been through a time that tested my\u00a0[resilience in business](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/4-strategies-to-turn-hard-times-into-resilience/462847) and life, I now understand the intricacies of leading through uncertainty.\n\n## The inevitability of uncertainty in entrepreneurship\n\nIn today\u2019s business landscape, uncertainty presents itself at every turn. This state of perpetual unpredictability is simply a factor of modern existence in the business world. It is a convergence of factors \u2014 technological leaps, global interconnections,\u00a0[economic changes](https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/8-ways-to-keep-your-business-afloat-in-a-tough-economy/448391), geopolitical issues and environmental challenges. Together, these factors weave a complex narrative and result in an environment where change is not just a possibility but a constant force that shapes the very fabric of entrepreneurial endeavors.\n\nYet, within these uncertainties lies a paradoxical truth \u2014 uncertainty, rather than a hindrance, can be a powerful\u00a0[catalyst for innovation](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/were-in-uncertain-times-heres-how-to-lead-through-them/445030)\u00a0and strategic thinking. Uncertainty can be a disruptor of conventional patterns, pushing entrepreneurs beyond their comfort zones and challenging established norms. The very nature of uncertainty demands a continuous reevaluation of strategies, which fosters a culture of adaptive planning and innovation. This can help businesses not just to survive but to thrive in an ever-changing market.\n\nMcKinsey & Company, a beacon of strategic consultancy,\u00a0[echoes the sentiment of embracing uncertainty](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/themes/how-to-manage-in-uncertainty). Their insights on managing uncertainty in business emphasize the critical importance of preparation for various outcomes. They advocate for a shift toward creative problem-solving approaches and the need for new operating models to respond to extreme uncertainty. Strategic courage, according to McKinsey, is paramount in volatile times, urging organizations to build resilience for an uncertain future. This resonates profoundly with the idea that navigating the uncertainties of today\u2019s business environments necessitates not just traditional strategies but innovative leadership and adaptable approaches.\n\n## Case study in entrepreneurial resilience\n\nIn the tumultuous IPO market of 2023, characterized by fluctuating valuations, tightened access to capital, rising interest rates, bank instability and global geopolitical challenges, several IPOs stood out as beacons of entrepreneurial resilience.

We advise our clients to take their time with this critical decision.

Selecting an investment banker early on is critical.\n\nHere are ten factors we look at for in an investment bank:\n\n*   How well does the bank know your industry?\n*   Who are the individuals at the bank who will lead the company\u2019s offering and who will serve as your primary contact, and are you comfortable with their approach?\n*   What are the most relevant, successful transactions they have worked on in your sector or a related industry?\n*   In those other IPOs, how well did the stock perform following the listings?\n*   Is the bank the right fit for the size and structure of your financing?\n*   What is its proposed strategy to differentiate your company from other recent offerings in your sector?\n*   Has the bank provided a description of the valuation methodology and a range to value your company?\n*   Does the bank share your company\u2019s values and excitement for this major milestone, and your vision for your company\u2019s future?\n*   What is the bank\u2019s reputation?

There were $166 billion in SPAC deals in just the first quarter of this year, exceeding the volume in all of 2020.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the excitement. But going public is a time-consuming, challenging process that is difficult for most small and mid-sized private companies to navigate alone.\n\nThere are so many questions to answer, such as: Is an IPO the right move for our company?

Developing a comprehensive roadmap and strategy is different for each company, and having one can ensure a smoother IPO execution.\n\n20 April 2022\n\n**Outlining the Road Map for Your Micro-Cap Company**\n\nFor both new and experienced Micro-cap officers and directors, embarking on an IPO can be somewhat intimidating especially given the complexity and lack of check-boxed guidelines for Micro-Cap IPO strategies. Developing a comprehensive roadmap and strategy is different for each company, and having one can ensure a smoother IPO execution. Proper IPO preparation and readiness is one of the critical elements for the commencement of life as a public company, which can be a memorable, gratifying and once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nA Micro-Cap Company may consider an initial public offering as a growth strategy for various reasons. Whether it be financing expansion, an exit strategy or recapitalization, an IPO may be an effective long-term strategy for early-stage Micro-Cap companies. However, the journey to executing an effective IPO requires a well-defined strategic road map.\u00a0\n\nThis involves detailed planning, experience, an appreciation of the unpredictable nature of the stock market, and an unwavering commitment to becoming a successful publicly listed company. Developing an IPO roadmap requires management to construct a business model, systems, and processes that can support credibility for investors. The IPO roadmap for a successful outcome will include an action plan, timeline, budget, communications, and team structure.\n\n*   **Listing Requirements** \u2013 Identifying the quantitative and qualitative requirements necessary and preparing and submitting exchange listing applications and related documentation.\n*   **General and Strategic** \u2013 The Company\u2019s operating philosophy and business model including each business line\u2019s growth strategies and objectives.\n*   **Finance** \u2013 Historical and projected financial results, including assumptions, operating performance, revenue, operating expenses, Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA), net income and earnings per share.\n*   **Management / Board of Directors** \u2013 The Company\u2019s management team and employees any pending or anticipated changes to key management, board composition, governance structures or corporate structure.\n*   **Valuation** \u2013 Valuation metrics including comparable company analysis,\u00a0 discounted cash flow analysis, current and precedent transactions analysis\u00a0\n*   **Legal, Regulatory and Risk Management** \u2013 Material disputes, litigation, claims, or possible claims pending or threatened against the Company.\u00a0\n*   **Corporate Communication** \u2013 Corporate Communications and Awareness Strategy, asset development, guidelines, and communication policies.\n*   **Environmental** \u2013 Appropriate licenses, permits, and approvals compliant in all material respects and policies to ensure the highest health, safety, and quality standards are met and maintained.\n\n**Listing Metrics**\u00a0\n\nA proper Roadmap for a Micro-Cap IPO will include a plan to satisfy the criteria\u00a0the company must satisfy in order to\u00a0list its common stock on an exchange. This is a critical element of understanding of the criteria including the financial requirements, the initial bid price, market value of listed securities, and market value of unrestricted publicly held shares as well as the corporate governance requirements needed to meet the exchange standards.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n**Putting the Puzzle Pieces in Place**\u00a0\n\nThink of these initial steps as throwing all the puzzle pieces out of a box, laying them out in front of you facing the right way up, and then putting them all together. The road map is the picture on the front of the puzzle box (which we can imagine is the Bell Ringing Day), and the steps ahead are the process of putting the puzzle pieces together. The IPO process and preparations are complex and consist of multiple steps and documentation.\u00a0\n\nBefore the IPO, the company must collect and deploy a great deal of data and documentation required to go public and be well scrutinized in the lead-up.

Before embarking on the IPO journey, assembling a knowledgeable IPO team will be crucial. It can take longer than you might think to find the team members with specialized knowledge and experience to send a strong signal to the market about the company\u2019s leadership, business model and governance strength. This team will include advisors current with the IPO market, its requirements and existing relationships to make relevant introductions, selection and negotiation of investment bankers, lawyers, accountants, and other professionals and the Exchanges.\u00a0\n\nThe team and your board of directors will have a say in relevant company issues like corporate governance, employee stock option policies, determining executive compensation, etc. Therefore, we recommend starting to assemble your board of directors early.\u00a0\n\nBoth before and after the IPO is complete, companies need to rely on their advisory team. Public companies will be subject to additional audits, quarterly reporting, investor and analyst updates, communication and awareness policies. Corporate governance and communication with investors take time and transparency and additional resources once the company is public.\n\nIndeed, the road to an IPO is challenging, but the right team can help firms find both the best partners and opportunities when they emerge.\u00a0\n\n_This post contains sponsored advertising content.

When selling a company, you run the risk of losing the very thing you worked hard to create. A venture capitalist may not share the same ideals as you do, especially when their primary concern is a return on their investment.\n\n1 April 2021\n\nIn contrast, an IPO allows you to retain management control of your company and continue to choose how you want to manage it along with board oversight.\n\nListing on a Senior Stock Exchange and going through the IPO processes is an excellent opportunity for entrepreneurial growth companies to access capital and enter capital markets. A micro-IPO is more accessible than ever before, and is a valuable and essential vehicle to access growth capital.\n\nThere\u2019s been a return to the high volume of IPOs seen during the dot-com era of the 1990s. However, after the dot-com bust, the Wall Street myth that small IPOs are too expensive and risky became widely accepted. During the dot-com bust, the notion that a small company should not take on the risk or burden of the costs, obligations and potential liability of an IPO became commonplace. This myth, perpetuated over the past 20 years, has created a barrier to entry at a considerable cost to entrepreneurs, investors and the world.\n\nAn IPO is perhaps more within reach than you might imagine and could be a significant way for your company to grow, access capital and gain market share.\n\nThe next installment of this monthly articles series will discuss how to access a micro-IPO and how to prepare for one.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1619, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a96c253e-1209-414b-a789-bd6e342b82a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "a96c253e-1209-414b-a789-bd6e342b82a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/exchange-listing-3/"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/exchange-listing-3/", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://exchangelistingllc.com/exchange-listing-3/"}, "hash": "671afa08c4bd6756d3fada2adfb281b444fd3f14eeb514efc66e4b8fc67ff402", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "# Exchange Listing- What do we do\n\n## We redefine the criteria, costs,  \ntimelines, and processes of listing on  \nsenior global stock exchanges and  \nsecuring transformational capital.\n\n## Our capabilities\n\n## We guide your company  \nthrough every step of  \nthe listing process  \nand beyond.\n\n### Listing types\n\n*   IPO\n*   Direct\n*   SPAC\n*   Reverse merger\n\n### Up-listing/cross-listing\n\n*   OTC **\u2192** NASDAQ\n*   Foreign **\u2192** NASDAQ\n*   Foreign **\u2192** ADR (NASDAQ)\n\n### Internationally recognized exchanges\n\n![](https://exchangelistingllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/logo-exchange-NYSE-300x102.png)\n\n![](https://exchangelistingllc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/nasdaq-good-website-300x85.png)\n\n### Financing\n\n*   Pre-IPO bridge financing\n*   Listing & capital raise\n*   Strategic financing\n*   Underwritten offering (concurrent with listing)\n*   Secondary offering\n\n## Scope of services\n\n## Turnkey listing and capital raise services.
