Detoxification\n\n# Detoxification happens in two main phases:\n\n# Phase I: P-450\n\nIn the first phase, the toxins can get metabolized via enzymes, cofactors and reactions.\n\n# Phase II: Conjugation\n\nIn the second phase, the metabolites undergo a second reaction, so they can be excreted or stored. If your liver is overwhelmed by the sheer amount of toxins and unable to conjugate newer toxins like microplastics and forever chemicals, huge parts of them get stored in your tissues and organs.\n\n# Endotoxins\n\n- end products metabolism\n- bacterial endotoxins\n\n# Exotoxins\n\n- drugs (prescription, OTC, recreational etc)\n- chemical agricultural\n- household\n- food additives\n- pollutants contaminants\n\n# PHASE I\n\n# PHASE II\n\n|Reactions|Enzymes|Cofactors|\n|---|---|---|\n|nonpolar lipid-soluble oxidation|cytochrome P-450 enzymes|Other Nutrients|\n|reduction|glucuronidation|more polar water-soluble|\n|hydrolysis|glutathione conjugation|water-soluble|\n|hydration|acetylation|amino acid conjugation|\n|dehalogenation|glycine| |\n\n# Key Nutrients\n\n- Riboflavin (vit B2)\n- Pyridoxine (vit B6)\n- Niacin (vit B3)\n- Folic acid\n- Vitamin B12\n- Glutathione\n- Branched chain amino acids\n\n# Detoxification Pathways\n\n|Superoxide|Antioxidants|Protective Nutrients|\n|---|---|---|\n|Plant Derivatives|carotenes (vit A)|Secondary metabolites|\n|tocopherols (vit E)|Free Radicals|copper|\n|zinc|manganese|coenzyme Q10|\n|thiols (cysteine)|bioflavonoids|Pycnogenol|\n|silymarin| | |\n\n# Excretion\n\n- Bile\n- Urine\n- Feces/Stools", "images": [{"name": "img_p7_1.png", "height": 615, "width": 828, "x": 36, "y": 280.83599999999996, "original_width": 1872, "original_height": 1390}], "items": [{"type": "heading", "lvl": 1, "value": "Detoxification", "md": "# Detoxification", "bBox": {"x": 350, "y": 222, "w": 9.171799999999983, "h": 11}}, {"type": "heading", "lvl": 1, "value": "Detoxification happens in two main phases:", "md": "# Detoxification happens in two main phases:", "bBox": {"x": 52, "y": 183, "w": 19.108737922705313, "h": 11}}, {"type": "heading", "lvl": 1, "value": "Phase I: P-450", "md": "# Phase I: P-450", "bBox": {"x": 52, "y": 86, "w": 72.116, "h": 11}}, {"type": "text", "value": "In the first phase, the toxins can get metabolized via enzymes, cofactors and reactions.", "md": "In the first phase, the toxins can get metabolized via enzymes, cofactors and reactions.", "bBox": {"x": 36, "y": 105, "w": 116.78920000000005, "h": 11}}, {"type": "heading", "lvl": 1, "value": "Phase II: Conjugation", "md": "# Phase II: Conjugation", "bBox": {"x": 52, "y": 164, "w": 105.11600000000001, "h": 11}}, {"type": "text", "value": "In the second phase, the metabolites undergo a second reaction, so they can be excreted or stored.
