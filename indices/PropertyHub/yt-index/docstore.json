going to break a   whole load of popular property   strategies down into three categories   those that are dead and buried some that   are past their Prime and some that are   fine but struggling right now then at   the end I'll share a couple that will   still work in 2024 in case you don't   know I'm a co-founder of property Hub   and we've been putting out a weekly   property podcast for more than 10 years   so we've seen a lot of Trends come and   go during that time so let's start with   the strategies that just don't work   anymore and probably never will again   the first is aggressive refinancing so   this is where the value of a property   goes up and you extend your mortgage to   pull out cash to invest in more now you   can still do that but I said aggressive   refinancing and it used to be very   aggressive indeed in the run-ups to the   last financial crash property prices", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2, "end_char_idx": 923,

money evaporate   but it reached a point where if I didn't   want my investing dreams to come to a   total standstill I was forced to develop   a system that overcame my fear and made   geography irrelevant so what was the   system and why do I believe that almost   every investor would be better off if   they skipped the painful Journey that I   went through and adopted it from the   start

sofa but then following it up with   in-person visits and on those visits you   can develop your knowledge further as   well as starting to build up your   network of local trades people agents   other investors people who can help you   out when you get to the second stage and   that second stage is removing yourself   from having to be in the area and   finding ways to operate there remotely   so at this stage you now know enough to   carry out the investment process   remotely and you can use your local   network to do the on the ground bits for   you so for example you can sit at home

job and you   spend your time on that project and you   improve the property hopefully if it's   come right you add value and then that   allows you to refinance and in this   example you're going to keep the   property and then reinvest the capital   into another project so that first   property will then give you rental   income and then you go on and do the   next project now this definitely speeds   things up but it's hard to do first of   all you need capital to start with so   you might not have the 250k so maybe   that's why you do this strategy so you   can build the portfolio up but
