Playbook:**\u00a0Win the long-tail, and scale up with them.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5292219d-c530-4c98-a2a9-41b2b227ab93/2.png)\n\n## Breakdown\n\n_**The how:**_ _The strategic playbook boiled down to 3x key takeaways_\n\n### **1.** Create the de facto \u2018entry point\u2019\n\nThe typical \u2018learn to code\u2019 journey starts something like this:\n\n*   Get inspired by an idea you\u2019ve dreamt up\n    \n*   Watch a few tutorials\n    \n*   Build the confidence to start coding\n    \n*   Reach inevitable decision point to (1) mock up your creation in a simple browser-based learning environment like CodePen, or (2) try to configure a fit-for-purpose local development environment.\n    \n\nIf you chose (1), you\u2019ll quickly create something tangible, before soon realising your environment can\u2019t support basic necessities like version control, new libraries, file structures, or databases that transform your \u2018idea\u2019 into a \u2018product\u2019.\n\nIf you chose (2), you\u2019ll be stuck for hours on gnarly beginner problems like configuring libraries, self-hosting, and environment setup, ballooning the time investment to \u2018publish\u2019 your creation.\n\nReplit creates option (3):\n\n*   No downloads. No config. No setup. Start coding instantly, right from your browser.\n    \n*   Every common library comes pre-installed.\n    \n*   All features you need to save and share your work available out-of-the-box.\n    \n\nImportantly, Replit recognises that catering to the requirements of a specific persona has as much to do with _adding features they need_ as it does _removing features they don\u2019t need_.\n\nReplit abstracts away complexities like package management, hosting, CICD, credentials, API keys, unit testing, and user authentication so users can focus on _creating_.\n\nA defensible strategy, but one that raises some valid challenges:\n\n\u2192 Firstly, what happens when your entry-level users outgrow the sophistication of your tool?\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/84786092-8e48-4c50-bde2-ba946ad84406/Untitled_design__1_.jpg?t=1707794192)\n\n\u2192 Secondly, entry-level users are the typically least valuable segment of any market. How will you create value effectively?\n\n**Replit\u2019s Position:** Relentless focus on \u2018playing the long-game\u2019.\n\nYes, their user base skews young and international, with 50% under 18 years old.\n\nBut, with a product that scales and up-skills its loyal users, if they can successfully retain those users as they get older, they have the potential to become the _platform of choice_ for writing code and generating wealth on the internet.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/dbb695d6-14f8-4e16-9e1e-3315858f64ef/Untitled_design__2_.jpg?t=1707794257)\n\n**Replit\u2019s ultimate bet:** Go after the long-tail, empower them to create wealth, and find a way to capture a fraction of the value it\u2019s users create.\n\n### **3.** Don\u2019t just create tools.

Breakdown\n\n_**The how:**_ _The strategic playbook boiled down to 3x key takeaways_\n\n### **1.**\u00a0Let users opt-in to an \u2018Activation\u2019 moment\n\nOne way to signal to your power-users that you value them:\n\nLet them signal _to you_ that they self-classify as a power-user.\n\n*   Enables \u2018Creator Analytics\u2019 which provides unique insights about your audience.\n    \n*   Enables creator tools such as \u2018LinkedIn Live\u2019 and \u2018LinkedIn Newsletter\u2019.\n    \n*   Let\u2019s you add a \u2018Custom Button\u2019 - a link that appears under your name on your profile and in the feed, allowing anyone to 1-click navigate to your website.\n    \n*   Moves your\u00a0\u2019Featured\u2019\u00a0and\u00a0\u2019Activity\u2019\u00a0sections to appear higher on your profile.\n    \n*   Displays the number of followers you have prominently on your profile.\n    \n*   Displays the topics you post about in the \u2018About\u2019 section of your profile as hashtags.\n    \n*   Turns the\u00a0\u2019Connect\u2019\u00a0button on your profile into a\u00a0\u2019Follow\u2019 button.\n    \n*   Makes people who request to \u2018Connect\u2019 with you automatically follow you.\n    \n*   Sends an automatic notification to new followers prompting them to subscribe to your \u2018LinkedIn Newsletter\u2019.\n    \n*   Makes you eligible to be featured\u00a0as a suggested creator to follow.\n    \n\nA user toggling-on \u2018Creator Mode\u2019 serves as an

signal that that user is now more likely to post original content, engage with others, use more features, spend more time on the platform, and less likely to churn.\n\n**Obvious statement #1:** Creators want information about their audience.\n\nCreator analytics is no recent concept - it\u2019s been a core value prop for creator platforms of choice like YouTube and Instagram for

They are honest and weren\u2019t written for the purpose of sharing.\n\nRather than manufacturing a reflection, why not use some of those ideas to tell the story of this year **as it actually happened?**\n\nSo, the rest of this article is a few elaborations on ideas extracted from journal entries, that for some reason or another are still resonant today.\n\nNo filter. No pressure. No structure. No motive.\n\nJust a handful of dated yet lasting musings from Year 1 of a humble attempt to [do great work.](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1-year-into-strategy-breakdowns)\n\n## 1\\. \u201cYour business is a perfect reflection of you\u201d\n\n_**17th October 2023**__**:**_\u00a0[_Pete_](https://x.com/nonmayorpete?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1-year-into-strategy-breakdowns) _and_ [_Noah_](https://x.com/noahedelman02?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1-year-into-strategy-breakdowns) _from_ [_The Neuron_](https://www.theneuron.ai/?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1-year-into-strategy-breakdowns) _visited Sydney for Pete\u2019s talk at_ [_SXSW_](https://www.mediaweek.com.au/sxsw-sydney-2023-mediaweek-recaps-friday/?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1-year-into-strategy-breakdowns)_, and I was nearing the point of convincing myself to quit my dream job to build Strategy Breakdowns full-time._\n\nThis is something Pete said to me that I didn\u2019t quite appreciate at the time.

As I traversed the [Dunning-Kruger curve](https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/dunning-kruger-effect?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1-year-into-strategy-breakdowns), I uncovered the long list of _input JTBD_ that each needed their own slice of learning, effort, and continuous improvement in order to get anywhere close to that goal.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/94d100ac-6d72-4b80-aecf-0fb05f88fa7c/writegrowsell.jpg?t=1718681851)\n\nAnyone with actual sales training would probably laugh at these really just being the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe exact same learning applied to both \u2018Write\u2019 and \u2018Grow\u2019.

To this day I try to juggle 15 balls at once, and despite constantly being told to just focus on 3, I persist and invariably end up fumbling things I never should have picked up, whilst failing to give enough attention to the ones I care about the most.\n\n(The side-projects that have launched are essentially always a product of locking myself in room for a weekend all-nighter until they are live. Totally unnecessary as a full-time creator.)\n\n**Lesson:** Side projects are a luxury for an early stage business.

I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some combination of Opens, Clicks, Subscriber Growth, Ad Conversions etc. but I haven\u2019t quite figured it out.\n\n**For readers,** I rather like the metric: Thoughtful email replies per 1000 recipients.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/704210a7-4cb5-4a5c-93ef-bcfef69f4281/readers.jpg?t=1718683547)\n\nFor a scaled, industrialised media operation, this NSM wouldn\u2019t even be shortlisted. For Strategy Breakdowns (a bootstrapped lifestyle business optimising for ecosystem value/goodwill/serendipity whilst being extremely fun-to-run) it feels pretty perfect.\n\n**For sponsors,** I came up with: Renewal revenue from inbound sponsors per quarter.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/3ba30d8e-b5b8-4f19-97df-2ad32aba43d8/sponsors.jpg?t=1718683598)\n\nMany important components of the end-to-end RevOps engine needs to be performing well QoQ in order for this NSM to remain healthy.\n\nNeither of these are locked in, or even monitored regularly to be honest.

only the wonderful articles, but the _companies themselves_.\n\nBuilt-in-public. Lean. World-class content. Independent. Audience-first.\n\nPossibly most important of all - they looked _**incredibly fun to run**_.\n\nI knew this was the type of company I wanted to build.\n\nBut, how to differentiate? Not a trivial question.\n\n2 mental models I used to think about this:\n\n1.  **Create what you wish existed**\n    \n\nThere was clearly a proven market for long, detailed, and comprehensive research articles on business strategy.\n\nI worked in the strategy team at Atlassian, putting me squarely within the target audience. But, as much as I loved getting hypnotically deep into a 30-minute read, it was a luxury I couldn\u2019t always afford.\n\nI knew this was on me, not the content itself, since [Not Boring](https://www.notboring.co/?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=6-months-into-strategy-breakdowns) and [The Generalist](https://www.generalist.com/?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=6-months-into-strategy-breakdowns) were both crushing it with the long-read format. But my hypothesis was that other readers were likely in the same boat as me.\n\nSo for my newsletter, I went the other direction: 3 minutes or less - never gets buried in your \u2018read it later\u2019 backlog.\n\n2.  **Build the product only you can build**\n    \n\nHarry explained \u201cI can do a bit of development, a bit of design, and I really like writing, specifically marketing stuff.\u201d\n\n(**Side note:** Harry\u2019s website \u201cMarketing Examples\u201d inspired the name \u201cStrategy Breakdowns\u201d. Clear, straightforward, and contains exactly what it says on the tin.)\n\nNow, I\u2019m no investor like [Mario Gabriele](https://twitter.com/mariogabriele?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=6-months-into-strategy-breakdowns), and had no capacity for producing exhaustive investment memo-like essays while working full-time.\n\nBut what I could do (and was spending all my working days at Atlassian doing) was break down strategic problems into a specific direction **in the shortest, but most convincing way possible**.\n\nPlus, I had a large backlog of relevant short-form social media content, performance data on those posts, and an audience of ~25,000 people interested in the subject.\n\nSo, I decided that each edition of my newsletter would be a concise, dense article on a **single idea.**\n\nOne playbook, growth hack, or tactical concept, that readers can quickly understand and get immediate practical value from.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at the last 6 months of _**actually building it**_.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5292219d-c530-4c98-a2a9-41b2b227ab93/2.png)\n\n## Business model and learnings\n\nMorning Brew famously had the words **\u201cWrite, grow, sell\u201d** written on the walls of their office.\n\nThe breakout success story in the newsletter space was laser-focussed on 3 things only:\n\n1.  **Write** - the best newsletter possible\n    \n2.  **Grow** - the number of readers, as fast as possible\n    \n3.  **Sell** - as many ads as possible (to fund \u2018**Write\u2019** and **\u2018Grow\u2019**)\n    \n\nOf course, each newsletter has unique characteristics that impact the goals and approach for each strategic pillar:\n\n1.  **Write** - how frequently? how many writers? what topics? what format? what voice?\n    \n2.  **Grow** - organic or paid? how aggressively? which channels? which target readers?\n    \n3.  **Sell** - ads? paid content? products? services? events? community? lead generation?\n    \n\nThe more time I spend building a newsletter business, the more meaningful this framework becomes.\n\nHere\u2019s the \u201c**Write, Grow, Sell\u201d** profile for Strategy Breakdowns:\n\n### **Write**\n\n_To describe the creative process behind Strategy Breakdowns, I\u2019ll use a slide from a recent creator workshop._\n\n!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 6450, "end_char_idx": 10333, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "243cd007-033b-489b-b62a-e68ef416ca7f": {"__data__": {"id_": "243cd007-033b-489b-b62a-e68ef416ca7f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/6-months-into-strategy-breakdowns"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/6-months-into-strategy-breakdowns", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/6-months-into-strategy-breakdowns"}, "hash": "f56856c714101f694d565802d084cebb3ec8c9f245caaca77b5de5fff1cd27d0", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "4f65109f-c943-419f-98e7-3b22d782f191", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/6-months-into-strategy-breakdowns"}, "hash": "f3a3c261b13423301a5a202a16e36b35b61a86e245dee1ad053174de8660e53c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b1401b18-a4ac-402c-89ab-37bea93c0f48", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "ddaf0cd611ba2f65d0103cc754ef2f61948faf5c35a14eff15706ad2caecc2e4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "**Sell** - as many ads as possible (to fund \u2018**Write\u2019** and **\u2018Grow\u2019**)\n    \n\nOf course, each newsletter has unique characteristics that impact the goals and approach for each strategic pillar:\n\n1.  **Write** - how frequently? how many writers? what topics? what format? what voice?\n    \n2.  **Grow** - organic or paid? how aggressively? which channels? which target readers?\n    \n3.  **Sell** - ads? paid content? products? services? events? community? lead generation?\n    \n\nThe more time I spend building a newsletter business, the more meaningful this framework becomes.\n\nHere\u2019s the \u201c**Write, Grow, Sell\u201d** profile for Strategy Breakdowns:\n\n### **Write**\n\n_To describe the creative process behind Strategy Breakdowns, I\u2019ll use a slide from a recent creator workshop._\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/eba1dd01-2310-40c9-a514-c62006d7bf62/cwenhic.jpeg?t=1704793773)\n\n#### **Daily content consumption**\n\nI make a point to keep a pulse on tech news, trends, and b2b creators to stay informed and generate ideas. My favourite business content generally comes from HackerNews, Twitter, LinkedIn, and email newsletters.\n\n#### **Save ideas to a database**\n\n*   Whenever I come across something that _could potentially be a social media post or newsletter article_, I will religiously save it to a database.\n    \n*   I use a system built in [Notion](https://affiliate.notion.so/strategy-breakdowns?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=6-months-into-strategy-breakdowns), and am a fan of the [Save to Notion](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/save-to-notion/ldmmifpegigmeammaeckplhnjbbpccmm?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=6-months-into-strategy-breakdowns) chrome extension for 1-click saving content from the browser to my workspace.\n    \n\n#### **Prioritise**\n\n*   For social media content, I calculate a weighted average of \u201cViral Potential\u201d and \u201cEffort\u201d to aid with prioritisation of (hundreds of) content ideas.\n    \n*   If this sounds a bit stale and formulaic, I assure you this system is more often than not overridden by \u201clets just write what Tom wants to write today\u201d. But still, we try.\n    \n\n#### **Write**\n\nJust as the slide recommends separating writing the hook (first 3 lines) of a LinkedIn / Twitter post from the rest of the post, I always separate writing the newsletter Subject Line and Preview Text from the email itself.\n\n*   **Tip:** You can do all the deliverability and open-rate optimisation in the world, but without a compelling Subject Line, people simply won\u2019t open your emails. You owe it to yourself to allocate 80:20 effort here - a slightly better Subject Line will be more impactful to your open-rate than any other change.\n    \n\n\u201c_Write fast. Break. Edit slow_\u201d \u2014 I don\u2019t recall where I first learned this idea, but it is now permanently ingrained into my process, and is the most common recommendation I give to new writers. There are 2 ideas here:\n\nFirstly, when I sit down to write, I do everything in my power to **just write as much as possible, as fast as possible**.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| *   Don\u2019t like how a sentence reads?

These recommendations appear when people sign up to Strategy Breakdowns, and occasionally in the newsletter articles themselves.\n\n*   This has been a highly variable, but nonetheless fruitful and frictionless revenue stream to date.\n    \n*   I expect the absolute monthly revenue to remain consistent, so this revenue stream will decrease as a percentage of overall revenue over time.\n    \n\n#### **Affiliate**\n\nAs well as fixed-fee ads, we promote affiliate links to products we use and love. These generate a commission for each successful purchase, and often provide _recurring revenue_ (when promoting SaaS tools). A small, but fast-growing and automated revenue stream I am quite excited about.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/208892da-3978-4e06-b818-9ed096c2e632/3.png)\n\n## What\u2019s next?\n\nThe last 6 months has been equal parts gripping and fatiguing.\n\nWhen I launched Strategy Breakdowns in June \u201823, I had no concrete expectations regarding growth or monetisation, but safe to say any guess I could\u2019ve made was exceeded. Scaling a side-project to 34,000 readers and a fully sold-out ad calendar from exclusively inbound leads is genuinely astonishing and humbling.\n\nBut, the approach taken was not a sustainable one.

It was e-mail\u201d \u2014 COO Reid Hoffman\n\nPayPal\u2019s bot would email sellers before it placed a bid, asking to transact via PayPal.\n\nEven if the bot didn\u2019t win the auction, sellers were exposed to PayPal, and perceived that it was already getting popular.\n\nBecause this all went down via email, PayPal started onboarding sellers without eBay even noticing.\n\n**Takeaway:** Never (ever) underestimate the power of cold emails.\n\n**2:**\u00a0**Network effects**\n\nBy the time eBay caught on to PayPal\u2019s tactics and built its native competitor \u2018Billpoint\u2019, it was too late.\n\nPayPal had secured power-sellers, and buyers were committed to their preferred payment method.\n\nDespite eBay\u2019s advantage in pushing Billpoint as the default checkout experience, a first-mover moat had formed around PayPal:\n\nSellers accepted PayPal because it was what buyers wanted, and buyers wanted it because more sellers accepted it.\n\n_Users used it because other users used it._\n\n**Takeaway:** If your product is more valuable with more users, it can be tough to kickstart, but it may also have built-in defensibility.\n\n**3:**\u00a0**Automated distribution**\n\nPayPal\u2019s end-to-end distribution strategy could be built and scaled with code.\n\nThis may seem obvious today, but at the time it was a key differentiator.\n\nSince eBay\u2019s network of sellers and auctions already existed online, PayPal didn\u2019t have to locate users itself.\n\nPayPal used eBay as a channel, scraping public information to target the most suitable prospects.\n\nBased on available metadata, they generated emails with templated content to pitch PayPal at scale.\n\nIf the seller agreed to use PayPal, they could simply reply to the email and a bid would automatically be placed.\n\n**Takeaway:** Always be on the lookout for opportunities to kill 1,000 birds with 1 stone.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/208892da-3978-4e06-b818-9ed096c2e632/3.png)\n\n## Rabbit Hole\n\n_**The where:**_ _3x high-signal resources to learn more_\n\n## Recommendations, friends, and sponsors\n\n**[Unyoked](https://www.unyoked.co/?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=paypal-s-robot-army)**\u00a0\\-\u00a0Beautiful secluded cabins.

What are they building to leverage in the near future? What is the strategic rationale behind these bets?\n\nAn often-heard counterweight to the AI revolution is: \u201cThe output just isn\u2019t that good\u201d. As of today, this is certainly true with respect to writing, editing, etc.\\*\n\n\\* _For readers from 10+ years in the future, when this seems like an unimaginable thing to say - the most advanced models at the time of writing are Claude 3 Opus, GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Llama 3._\n\nA thesis I\u2019ve been developing to identify which industries / companies / value chains / JTBD will _definitely be disrupted by AI_ is:  \nThose revolving around things that AI is undeniably 10-100x better at than humans **already.**\n\n2 characteristics instantly come to mind:\n\n1.  **Processing speed:** Sure, GPT-4o can\u2019t write a 10/10 2000-word article. But it can write a 7/10 2000-word article in 5 seconds.\n    \n2.  **High-volume data ingestion:** It might take a human ~2hrs to skim read and take notes from 20x sources. AI can ingest 200x sources in 5 seconds.\n    \n\nA low-hanging fruit to apply this principle to is supercharging scaled services businesses that are _already successful_. Why?\n\nAI essentially transforms human services (labour and time-intensive) into tech products (automated, scalable, near-instant). It removes the \u2018delivery\u2019 element of certain tasks that could not previously be \u2018automated\u2019 in the traditional sense, but now they can.\n\nSegueing into today\u2019s article, last week I was lucky enough to sit down and nerd out with the founder & CEO of a company who\u2019s betting on _this exact strategy_.\n\n[Bill Kerr](https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/all/?fetchDeterministicClustersOnly=true&heroEntityKey=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAABTuYE0BlPd1NrYSo4Lfe6WAsjR1iNTOX1c&keywords=bill+kerr&origin=RICH_QUERY_SUGGESTION&position=0&searchId=2af615ed-0f70-4102-a454-78d1e9283bd7&sid=Y3K&spellCorrectionEnabled=false&utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=athyna-s-ai-for-talent-strategy) runs [Athyna](https://partnerslink.athyna.com/tomfromstrategybreakdowns6731-3a5pv?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=athyna-s-ai-for-talent-strategy) - one of the leading platforms for hiring remote talent.

Optimise your LinkedIn profile, generate tailored resumes, and run their proprietary AI Matching Index across jobs you think you might be a fit for.\n\n**\u2192 Size of talent pool:** By creating massive value for job-seekers, Ava connects Athyna with a tech-forward, motivated, and AI-native segment of the talent market.\n\n**\u2192 Usage of talent pool:** Ava\u2019s first-party product data gives Athyna even better visibility into key talent insights such as job-search status, work readiness, and personal preferences.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/751e1174-c568-4305-b8e2-c3085ddfd1ca/Untitled_design__49_.png?t=1716216873)\n\nSome fun Ava mockups\n\n**Strategy #2 - Job Board:** Athyna is building a global jobs board for not only Athyna jobs, but all remote jobs.\n\n**\u2192 Size of talent pool:** The job board creates a new surface for inbound talent generation to Athyna. This expands the size of the pool that can be considered for Athyna jobs.\n\n**\u2192 Usage of talent pool:** Like Ava, the job board doubles as a data play. Measuring traffic, clicks, job page views, visit durations, bounce rates, applications started, applications submitted, and countless other data points enables better understanding, and therefore usage, of the available talent.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/42c5c847-e67d-4cf4-ac74-09f69c1e0642/Untitled_design__47_.png?t=1716216706)\n\nHere\u2019s a gem you won\u2019t find elsewhere: Bill scribbling over an Amazon memo (regarding adding 3rd party sellers to Amazon.com) to frame the Athyna job board strategy.\n\nThe second exam question for any recruitment business is:\n\n_How do we match the right talent to the job?_\n\nQuality of matching comes through the depth of talent, and how well you can blend the recruiters eye with machine intelligence.\n\n\u2014 Bill Kerr\n\nWhen it comes down to it, talent-role-fit is a matter of matching variables with one another:\n\n*   Skills\n    \n*   Timing\n    \n*   Experience\n    \n*   Motivations\n    \n*   Compensation\n    \n\nEven for more nuanced aspects like \u2018culture\u2019, you are still ultimately looking for \u201cdoes the candidate\u2019s personality / values / quirks fit the employer\u2019s?\u201d\n\nHistorically, this has been one of gnarliest problems to solve in talent acquisition, since there\u2019s such a large volume of variables that go into pairing the right match.\n\nA perfect example of something that can be solved (or at least dramatically improved) algorithmically.\n\nOne of the things AI is _already significantly better than humans at_ is ingesting extremely large volumes of data.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 8631, "end_char_idx": 12650, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "54f6f832-e255-4afa-9bdf-37f19c9da981": {"__data__": {"id_": "54f6f832-e255-4afa-9bdf-37f19c9da981", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/athyna-ai-strategy"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/athyna-ai-strategy", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/athyna-ai-strategy"}, "hash": "420128a54fda42c834f8d98030703d1dbebad08cd51d4ab6b0124ad50cac9f84", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d1ffa34f-062e-4990-ba9d-6519e3537614", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/athyna-ai-strategy"}, "hash": "17307de54e7b4643946e978cff4d194cb624a55e47be2a928bb07797c1539d72", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "The second exam question for any recruitment business is:\n\n_How do we match the right talent to the job?_\n\nQuality of matching comes through the depth of talent, and how well you can blend the recruiters eye with machine intelligence.\n\n\u2014 Bill Kerr\n\nWhen it comes down to it, talent-role-fit is a matter of matching variables with one another:\n\n*   Skills\n    \n*   Timing\n    \n*   Experience\n    \n*   Motivations\n    \n*   Compensation\n    \n\nEven for more nuanced aspects like \u2018culture\u2019, you are still ultimately looking for \u201cdoes the candidate\u2019s personality / values / quirks fit the employer\u2019s?\u201d\n\nHistorically, this has been one of gnarliest problems to solve in talent acquisition, since there\u2019s such a large volume of variables that go into pairing the right match.\n\nA perfect example of something that can be solved (or at least dramatically improved) algorithmically.\n\nOne of the things AI is _already significantly better than humans at_ is ingesting extremely large volumes of data.\n\nWith Athyna investing into Ava, job boards, AI skills assessments, analytics engines, and other initiatives that expand the talent pool _and_ the density of data points across that talent pool, this feels like a clear winning bet.\n\nA human _without_ an AI won\u2019t be able to compete against a human _with_ an AI once the game involves millions of data-points on millions of applicants.\n\n### **3.** \u2026a**t lightning speed**\n\nNot only can AI ingest far more data than a human, it can also do so much faster.\n\nSeveral orders of magnitude faster.\n\nBringing days of work down to _seconds_.\n\nImagine you\u2019re recruiting for a role where cultural fit is incredibly important to the employer.

You request access, with no specified timeline for when you\u2019d be accepted\n    \n\nFor option 1 users, Pinterest felt like a community you were personally _chosen to join,_ so you\u2019d naturally be a more engaged participant.\n\nFor option 2 users, the uncertainty created a sense of anticipation, so once the invitation finally came, you\u2019d be more likely to engage, and even share on Facebook or Twitter that you were selected for early access.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/51076985-2388-4601-9dc3-7d748a127552/Newsletter_1999x900.png?t=1712624236)\n\nIf you had no access, you could still see current members\u2019 pins and boards, but you couldn\u2019t create pins or curate boards of your own.\n\nYou could even view the product, but you couldn\u2019t play with it yourself.\n\nFrom the inside, your access was a status symbol as an early adopter \u2192 not just of something new, but something new **and** exclusive.\n\nIt made Pinterest less like a mainstream trend, and more like a scarce resource.\n\nParadoxically, the way to grow wide was to start narrow.\n\nGetting users to invite more users is viral growth 101.\n\nGenerally, the aim is to maximise the number of referrals per user to drive up \u201cK-factor\u201d (viral coefficient).\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/28abaf84-d2e7-4814-ae15-be7f67382f14/Newsletter_1999x900__1_.png?t=1712624560)\n\nRather than seeking to incentivise users to refer their entire network, Pinterest counterintuitively gave each user only a _limited number of invites._\n\nThis worked for a number of reasons:\n\n**Exclusive brand:** Limited invites aligned with the exclusive allure they were creating - not only was Pinterest \u201cinvite-only\u201d, it created the perception that it was difficult to get an invite at all.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2408, "end_char_idx": 6062, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9d30a552-f2a9-4e89-82e1-a9c8b1c6fac8": {"__data__": {"id_": "9d30a552-f2a9-4e89-82e1-a9c8b1c6fac8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/pinterests-growth-paradox"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/pinterests-growth-paradox", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/pinterests-growth-paradox"}, "hash": "99957684563d6c17bd7d6343d9fadbd7963aabba4073d1aa39ce0337eed13b99", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "cabc696c-fb9d-480b-a708-0928d0abaa57", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/pinterests-growth-paradox"}, "hash": "2c9c0a621ef0b85732cfb028889eb33cebccc52fa59ced2b41a4d557221817c3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Getting users to invite more users is viral growth 101.\n\nGenerally, the aim is to maximise the number of referrals per user to drive up \u201cK-factor\u201d (viral coefficient).\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/28abaf84-d2e7-4814-ae15-be7f67382f14/Newsletter_1999x900__1_.png?t=1712624560)\n\nRather than seeking to incentivise users to refer their entire network, Pinterest counterintuitively gave each user only a _limited number of invites._\n\nThis worked for a number of reasons:\n\n**Exclusive brand:** Limited invites aligned with the exclusive allure they were creating - not only was Pinterest \u201cinvite-only\u201d, it created the perception that it was difficult to get an invite at all.\n\n**Scarcity effect:** People have a cognitive bias towards placing [higher value on things that are scarce](https://www.notion.so/f207e0e612674e4fa28ea386b899d8e3?pvs=21&utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pinterest-s-growth-paradox). By giving users a limited number of invites, each one became a careful choice, which in turn maximised the _likelihood_ that users would invite others _at all_.\n\n**Engaged referrals:** The limitation encouraged users to only invite those who would _actually value the platform_. This led to the growth of higher-quality, more-engaged users.\n\n### **3.**\u00a0**Bypass network activation**\n\nOne fundamental problem with being so restrictive about letting new users into a social network is the \u201ccold start problem\u201d.\n\nUsers rely on \u201cnetwork effects\u201d to get value, meaning the app is only valuable if they can quickly interact with their friends, colleagues, local community, interest groups etc.\n\nAn exclusive community like early Pinterest risks having no relevant content to show new users.\n\n2 tactics they use to solve for this:\n\n**Auto-follow**\n\nTo populate the platform with initial high-quality content, founder Ben Silbermann personally reached out to a group of design, arts, and crafts bloggers.\n\nThen, when early users signed up, they were automatically set to following these creators, and were immediately presented with an aesthetic feed.\n\n**Social signup**\n\nPinterest bypassed needing to create a [social graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_graph?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=pinterest-s-growth-paradox) of its users from scratch by leveraging existing networks like Facebook and Twitter.\n\nNew users were prompted to \u2018Connect with Facebook / Twitter\u2019, which connected them to their friends out-of-the-box, and greeted them with a page full of content from people they know.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/862234cf-cdca-4c7f-ac0f-9a445e14ada5/Untitled_design__29_.png?t=1712586367)\n\nBoth tactics made the first app session more valuable, reducing the churn likelihood of new users.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/208892da-3978-4e06-b818-9ed096c2e632/3.png)\n\n## Rabbit Hole\n\n_**The where:**_ _3x high-signal resources to learn more_\n\nThanks for being here.\n\n\u2014 Tom Alder\n\nP.S.

The \u2018interview\u2019 is a timeless content format that allows us to resolve speculations with stories.\n\nBut interviews also come with downsides, from the perspective of the reader:\n\n*   **Context:** If you don\u2019t have context on the company the interviewee represents, it\u2019s less interesting.\n    \n*   **Questions:** The success of the interview depends on the calibre of the questions. As a reader you don\u2019t get to ask the specific questions you\u2019d most like to hear the interviewee answer.\n    \n*   **Format:** The best video and audio conversations make you feel like a \u2018fly-on-the-wall\u2019 to a moment you wouldn\u2019t otherwise experience. That feeling doesn\u2019t translate well to written interviews.\n    \n\nThis email is a humble attempt to solve these aspects.\n\n**Here are the Release Notes for today\u2019s** **edition** **version (v0.1.43):**\n\n1.  **Context:** Our [first piece on Attio](https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/attio-shapeshifting-product) explored their product strategy, and how they are attacking a legacy software category through contemporary product philosophy.

You go to the feature list of any CRM and there are thousands on there, so there are so many tempting opportunities in that regard.<br><br>But what we've done is that we've created a set of product principles at Attio, which means there\u2019s a pretty clear decision framework for us to use when we decide what to build. As much as possible we try to build features that are applicable to more than just one particular problem so they can be used again to add to the toolkit of things that Attio can do. So we really think about the sort of the core systems and how we can improve those rather than adding new ones.<br><br>An example of this might be that someone might want a very specific feature like, they want a Slack notification when a deal has gone stale for more than seven weeks. We could build that as a feature but then someone would say they want a Slack notification when they\u2019ve won more than ten deals in a month.

they are _made to be shared_.\n\nBy turning each user into a mixtape curator, Spotify created a system for people to create and share _Spotify invite links_ in a meaningful, personal, and non-spammy way.\n\nPlaylists became the fuel for Spotify\u2019s organic growth engine.\n\n**2: A new surface for innovation**\n\nOver time, Spotify adapted playlists to make them as shareable, personalised, sticky, and monetisable as possible:\n\n*   **Collaborative playlists:** Create playlists with your friends (and invite them to Spotify in the process).\n    \n*   **Public playlists:** Let anyone listen to your playlists, and display them proudly on your Spotify profile.\n    \n*   **Smart shuffle:** Get personalised song recommendations interspersed throughout your playlist (for Premium users only - driving increased conversions).\n    \n*   **\u201cMade for you\u201d playlists:** Get algorithmically generated playlists, based on your activity, for an auditory journey that is uniquely yours.\n    \n*   **Sponsored playlists:** Give brands access to a listener\u2019s moods, moments, contexts, and desires, by featuring their messaging in ad-breaks for free users.\n    \n\n**3: Playlists as a strategic moat**\n\nBy synthesising vast amounts of metadata on song pairings, preferences, behaviours, listening history, and platform interactions, Spotify emerged with the unique ability to craft perfectly curated \u201c[Editorial Playlists](https://support.spotify.com/in-en/artists/article/types-of-spotify-playlists/?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=playlists-are-spotify-s-moat)\u201d.\n\nThese became the guiding tool to minimise listeners\u2019 selection cognitive load, making Spotify the go-to place for music discovery.\n\nEditorial Playlists also marked a broader shift of powers in the music industry: putting Spotify \u201c[in control of the demand curve](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305120933291?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=playlists-are-spotify-s-moat).\u201d\n\nSince Spotify doesn\u2019t own the music on its platform, playlists are the key mechanism through which they exert \u201ccuratorial power\u201d and build strategic advantage.\n\nNearly every screen in the app (Home, Search, Genres, \u201cPicked for You\u201d, even artist profiles) funnels users towards Editorial Playlists.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f1008769-9fda-4c59-85cc-aa73da35724d/Jazz__1_.png?t=1700556468)\n\n!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2830, "end_char_idx": 6510, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3b23ad44-fa2c-46ec-b0f7-04814d0ee25a": {"__data__": {"id_": "3b23ad44-fa2c-46ec-b0f7-04814d0ee25a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/spotify-playlists-moat"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/spotify-playlists-moat", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/spotify-playlists-moat"}, "hash": "19cffd85b37734c01e9f4d3ccdc7ea805aea334d6a2c102993f7a58b53c215a3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "11310a3a-f3b1-45b1-bed2-4211953303c3", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/spotify-playlists-moat"}, "hash": "b7978877ba3b17317e752a367951b888c1ed4a917504d5d5627270ff46a8b93c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Nearly every screen in the app (Home, Search, Genres, \u201cPicked for You\u201d, even artist profiles) funnels users towards Editorial Playlists.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f1008769-9fda-4c59-85cc-aa73da35724d/Jazz__1_.png?t=1700556468)\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/208892da-3978-4e06-b818-9ed096c2e632/3.png)\n\n## Rabbit Hole\n\n_**The where:**_ _3x high-signal resources to learn more_\n\n## Recommendations, friends, and sponsors\n\n[**\\[Aggregation Theory\\]**](https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=playlists-are-spotify-s-moat) **\u2192** A short 5-minute read that\u2019ll redefine how you think about strategic moats of large tech companies: \u201cThe best aggregators\u2026 aggregate modularized suppliers \u2014 which they often don\u2019t pay for \u2014 to consumers/users with whom they have an exclusive relationship at scale.\u201d\n\n[**\\[Newsletter Mastery\\]**](https://www.alexbrogan.com/waitlist?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=playlists-are-spotify-s-moat) **\u2192** Our friend Alex Brogan is launching his long-awaited course detailing exactly how he\u2019s grown 2x newsletters to 50k subscribers each\u2026 while working full time.

So, our own strategy feels like a valuable (and hopefully interesting) thing to share with you.\n\n\u2192 Strategy Breakdowns isn\u2019t built in a vacuum. Quite the opposite in fact. One of the most wonderful attributes of audience-first business models is the high volume of feedback and interaction. Every article, decision, and update we\u2019ve made has been influenced by reader interaction - a fundamental part of our DNA.\n\n\u2192 Our favourite brands aren\u2019t just the ones with an incredible product. Its those that we know the story of, align with, and feel connected to. Resonance, taste, and craftsmanship are some aspirational qualities we strive for, so its a privilege to have the ability bring you closer to that process.\n\n**In that spirit - here\u2019s 3 quick updates (plus, some reader feedback that influenced each one):**\n\n**1\\. Added categorisation to our articles on the Strategy Breakdowns website (**[**strategybreakdowns.com**](https://strategybreakdowns.com/)**).** Quite a funny exercise to create these retrospectively.

Tesla initially justified the changes on the basis of new features, performance upgrades, and deals.\n\nAs price changes continued, sometimes week to week, even without changes to the vehicles, customers became accustomed to them.\n\nNow, the mere _potential_ for change creates a psychological effect that motivates customers to make quicker purchasing decisions, fearing further increases.\n\nSimilar to volatile stock prices, Tesla\u2019s cars are \u2018probably better to buy today than tomorrow\u2019.\n\n**Takeaway:** Price sensitivity is important, but don\u2019t underestimate how much consumer preferences can change.\n\n**3:**\u00a0**Price elasticity of demand**\n\nTesla recognised that locking in a price for a full year meant leaving money on the table if consumer willingness-to-pay rose.\n\nOn the other hand, it exposed them to supply chain risks if demand for their cars dropped.\n\nWhen this happens, dynamic pricing lets Tesla respond by dropping prices to immediately stimulate demand.\n\nWhen external factors like inflation, parts shortages, and new market entrants impact Tesla\u2019s unit economics, they can instantly de-risk their operations and pass on the cost to customers.\n\n**Takeaway:** Build in ways to respond to changes outside of your control.\n\nOne tweak to the traditional automotive business model \u2192 several competitive advantages.\n\nOptimal entry pricing.

retention.**\n\n**Incentive #2: Reward the referrer and the referred**\n\nOriginally inspired by PayPal\u2019s double-sided $10 reward, Dropbox issued the 250mb storage bonus to both the existing user as well as the new referred user.\n\nExisting users are more likely to refer friends _and_ new referred users are more likely to convert.\n\nPlus, new users joining through the referral program are **more likely to become referrers themselves**, creating a viral loop.\n\n**Incentive #3: Reward activations over shares**\n\nThe referral rewards were only issued when referred users actually sign up and start using the product.\n\nThis encouraged referrers to be more than just net promoters who shared Dropbox on social media.\n\nThey became enthusiastic sellers who would follow-up with friends to make sure they onboarded to the product, **actively pushing them down the activation funnel.**\n\n**Incentive #4: Improve rewards for paid users**\n\nAs a pioneering \u2018freemium\u2019 product, Dropbox offered a generous free plan, but relied on paying subscribers for monetisation.\n\nWhile free Dropbox users earned 250mb of free storage per referral, up to 16gb, Dropbox Plus / Family / Professional accounts received 500mb per referral, up to 32gb.\n\nThe referral program became a product-led-growth engine for **paid upgrades as well as free user growth.**\u200b\u200b\n\nDropbox provided various mechanisms that made it as frictionless as possible for users to invite their friends, at scale.\n\n**Bulk invite contacts:**\n\n*   Enter email credentials\n    \n*   Automatically pull contacts from Gmail, AOL, Hotmail, or Yahoo\n    \n*   Select contacts to bulk invite without leaving Dropbox\n    \n\n**Invite individual email addresses:**\n\n*   Copy-paste email addresses\n    \n*   Send invites multiple invites with 1-click\n    \n\n**Share on social media:**\n\n*   Pre-written post\n    \n*   Authenticate with Facebook or Twitter credentials\n    \n*   Instantly share with your entire network\n    \n\n**Unique invite link:**\n\n*   1-click to copy link\n    \n*   Manually share with friends\n    \n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/b4167b43-6c30-4355-9700-9cd51a7ce3dd/Add_a_heading__2_.png?t=1715042882)\n\nThe

**3.**\u00a0**An integrated experience, not an afterthought**\n\nDropbox leverages various tactics and touchpoints to make its referral program as visible as possible throughout the user journey.\n\n**Onboarding:** When new users sign up to Dropbox, they are introduced to the program _as one of the onboarding steps_.\n\n\u2192 Even if the user doesn\u2019t refer right away, they are at least made aware of the program, so will remember it when the time is right.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5fc30a4c-a09f-45a0-998b-9ad8e4509011/Untitled__31_.png?t=1714743231)\n\n**Running out of space:** Users are reminded that they can get free extra storage when they are close to using up their current limit.\n\n\u2192 Timing the CTA when user intent is high.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/80679703-6b64-449c-bbcf-d55766f28e54/Untitled_design__20_.png?t=1715043269)\n\n**Tracking dashboard:** Dropbox provides users with a panel, accessible at any time, to see how their invites have performed and how much space they have earned in total.\n\n\u2192 Detailed status tracking incentivises users to follow up with whoever they\u2019ve invited.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/44407b0e-22b5-4b46-a25d-72bd9e0b98af/images_newsletter__1999_x_900_px___1_.png?t=1715043567)\n\n**Core usage:** Dropbox was engineered to be viral - when users share a file with someone who is not a Dropbox user, the recipient is invited to open an account.\n\n\u2192 Even without actively participating in the referral program, users become referrers _just by using the product ordinarily_.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a77b2641-0a9f-40d9-bf87-fe7adcd174bb/images_newsletter__1999_x_900_px___2_.png?t=1715043745)\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/208892da-3978-4e06-b818-9ed096c2e632/3.png)\n\n##

prospective customers, your needs would be met with the cheapest iPad on offer\u2026\n\nbut you end up spending an additional 82% (+$270) on the iPad Air.\n\nWhy is that?\n\nThe answer begins with the \u201cCenter-Stage Effect\u201d:\n\nWhen customers are presented with a range of choices, they perceive the middle options to be the _best value-for-money._\n\nMost buyers don\u2019t consider themselves a _power-user_ needing a \u2018Pro\u2019 device.\n\nBut there\u2019s also natural aversion to buying a \u2018previous-gen\u2019 device.\n\n\ud83d\udca1\u00a0**Strategy Playbook:** Assemble pricing ladders that leverage cognitive biases to draw customers towards premium products.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5292219d-c530-4c98-a2a9-41b2b227ab93/2.png)\n\n## Breakdown\n\n_**The how:**_ _The strategic playbook boiled down to 3x key takeaways_\n\n**1: Incremental upgrades**\n\nDue to the \u201cCenter-Stage Effect\u201d, you\u2019re likely to initiate your purchase flow with the 10th Gen iPad.\n\nAfter choosing a colour, you\u2019re asked to \u201cChoose how much space you\u2019ll need\u201d: _64GB or 256GB._\n\nFor 4x the storage, it\u2019s just an extra $150.\n\nOne scroll later, you must \u201cChoose how you\u2019ll stay connected\u201d: _Wi-Fi only, or Wi-Fi + Cellular._\n\nAgain, another $150.\n\nEach upsell is introduced one-by-one, taking up the entire viewport, rather than all at once to gauge them holistically.\n\nAs you assess each incremental upsell, \"Consistency Bias\" stops you from reverting decisions you previously committed to.\n\nWhether you picked extra storage or cellular connectivity, it won\u2019t take long to realise that the extra $150 could instead cover upgrading to the iPad Air.\n\nWhen evaluated against the equally-priced storage or cellular add-ons, getting the Air feels like a no-brainer.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1a94375f-633c-429c-9b90-5741cd91debc/12341.png?t=1701744260)\n\n**2: Win the persuadable cohort**\n\nThere are 3 cohorts of iPad buyers:\n\n1.  People who want the cheapest iPad.\n    \n2.  People who want the best iPad on the market.\n    \n3.  People who want the iPad with the best value-for-money.\n    \n\nFor cohort 1 buyers, no amount of extra functionality will justify spending any more than necessary for core features like checking emails and watching Netflix.\n\nCategory 2 buyers go straight for the iPad Pro, along with all the bells and whistles, knowing they\u2019re getting the best tablet money can buy.\n\nCategory 3 buyers are the \u201cswing voters\u201d - they may have an initial preference for cheaper cost or higher performance, but ultimately they make decisions based on a value assessment of options presented to them.\n\nApple\u2019s pricing strategies are designed to maximise the Average Cart Value (\u201dACV\u201d) of cohort 3.\n\n**3: Drive value across the ecosystem**\n\nApple uses variations of the same strategies to incentivise upgrades across each device range:\n\n*   Prior Gen \u2192 Current Gen\n    \n*   Faster performance\n    \n*   Additional storage\n    \n*   More connectivity\n    \n*   \u201cMini\u201d / \u201cMax\u201d\n    \n*   \u201cAir\u201d / \u201cPro\u201d\n    \n\nAnd then there\u2019s peripherals.\n\nPlan to draw, write, create? _Get the Apple Pencil._\n\nSpend a lot of time typing?", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3191, "end_char_idx": 7005, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7203ea9-8991-42f8-aa09-71aef29f28bd": {"__data__": {"id_": "f7203ea9-8991-42f8-aa09-71aef29f28bd", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/apple-pricing-strategy"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/apple-pricing-strategy", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/apple-pricing-strategy"}, "hash": "4ac50017b933341688bcb2de85fe1ccdb31cd076226e6334ae002ad73847941b", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "d74727c7-0bc3-4c43-96e8-7bc406dfc74b", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/apple-pricing-strategy"}, "hash": "f06409fd71eda018ef21bf715ff8955de028b7a6f82eb9eca58a2272de7254d2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "Category 2 buyers go straight for the iPad Pro, along with all the bells and whistles, knowing they\u2019re getting the best tablet money can buy.\n\nCategory 3 buyers are the \u201cswing voters\u201d - they may have an initial preference for cheaper cost or higher performance, but ultimately they make decisions based on a value assessment of options presented to them.\n\nApple\u2019s pricing strategies are designed to maximise the Average Cart Value (\u201dACV\u201d) of cohort 3.\n\n**3: Drive value across the ecosystem**\n\nApple uses variations of the same strategies to incentivise upgrades across each device range:\n\n*   Prior Gen \u2192 Current Gen\n    \n*   Faster performance\n    \n*   Additional storage\n    \n*   More connectivity\n    \n*   \u201cMini\u201d / \u201cMax\u201d\n    \n*   \u201cAir\u201d / \u201cPro\u201d\n    \n\nAnd then there\u2019s peripherals.\n\nPlan to draw, write, create? _Get the Apple Pencil._\n\nSpend a lot of time typing? _Get the Magic Keyboard Folio._\n\nTie it all together with some AirPods that seamlessly work across all devices\u2026\n\nor maybe AirPod Pros\u2026\n\nor even AirPods Max!\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/cee2ac47-3aa4-4e1f-89cc-ee7cd2fa4648/6__1_.png?t=1701744357)\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/208892da-3978-4e06-b818-9ed096c2e632/3.png)\n\n## Rabbit Hole\n\n_**The where:**_ _3x high-signal resources to learn more_\n\n## Recommendations, friends, and sponsors\n\n[**\\[Selling to Corporate\\]**](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/selling-to-corporate/id1469526548?ls=1&utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-apple-makes-you-spend-more) **\u2192** Business owners and industry leaders are seeing career-changing outcomes by listening to this fast-growing podcast: _\u201cIt\u2019s literally like having your own personal sales coach and mentor.\u201d_\u00a0[Subscribe Now.](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/selling-to-corporate/id1469526548?ls=1&utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-apple-makes-you-spend-more)\u00a0\n\n**[\\[Winning a backwards market\\]](https://retro.social/@ifixcoinops/111480744130939877?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-apple-makes-you-spend-more)** **\u2192** A fascinating thread this week about how Brother is winning the consumer printer market, not by offering the best printer, but by being the only market player that hasn\u2019t become _considerably worse for customers_ over time.

Identified a personal pain point they felt in their daily lives.\n    \n2.  Wrote a document describing the problem and got feedback from potential users.\n    \n3.  Worked with a designer to create mockups of a solution to get more feedback.\n    \n4.  Found engineers to build the minimum viable product (MVP).\n    \n5.  Partnered with influencers in their niche to promote the extension, offering revenue share deals.\n    \n\nNow, they replicate this exact playbook with founders and executives looking to integrate AI into their businesses.\n\nCame across this strategy accidentally - exactly as Calm intended. 1 of thousands of people that enter their organic video content funnel every day.\n\nOnce I hit send I\u2019m off for a 10 minute meditation.\n\nEnjoy.\n\nP.S.

But they always learned along the way (ie which markets, technology, and businesses are viable), which expedited their path to profitability.\u00a0\n\nIn retrospect, given their discipline in winding down losing bets, most of the investments don\u2019t seem so bad:\u00a0\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/2fb23a51-3ada-49ab-8613-f80c50489f52/4.png?t=1710847549)\n\nMeaning if those markets ended up being good picks in the long run, Uber will still be a winner.\u00a0\n\n### **3.**\u00a0**Don\u2019t lose the forest for the trees**\n\nThe pandemic incidentally gave Uber a natural chance to evaluate their portfolio and rebaseline their bets.\n\nIn 2020 and 2021 they were busy surviving the pandemic and cutting corporate costs.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, they were suspiciously quiet on the M&A front:\u00a0\n\n**Ridesharing:** Car Next Door (2022)\n\n**Technology:** Transplace (2022)\n\n**New Verticals:** N/A\n\nUber didn\u2019t abandon their acquisition strategy.

Album cover. Name Tag.\n\nIf people design it, Canva has it.\n\nEach landing page is an SEO goldmine, with fast-loading keyword-rich content that ranks Canva at the top of Google\u2019s search results page.\n\nUnlike their front page, which is probably swamped with low-intent evaluators, these utility-focussed lead magnets capture highly convertible leads wanting to land in-product as quickly as possible.\n\n**2:** **Overdeliver on core Job-To-Be-Done**\n\nInstead of an aggressive sales page, Canva provides value straight out of the gate:\n\n*   Free templates\n    \n*   Design inspiration\n    \n*   Simple video tutorials\n    \n*   Easy-to-use design tool\n    \n\nBut - Canva isn\u2019t just a lightweight \u2018Business Card Maker\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s a powerful editor packed wth a rich featureset that other purpose-built competitors can\u2019t match.\n\nUsers landing in a business card template are quickly delighted with the unparalleled array of fonts, icons, borders, palettes, frames, and illustrations freely available.\n\nPlus, the experience is so easy, from the second you try the tool, you already know how to use it.\n\n**3:** **Product-led upsells**\n\nThroughout the onboarding journey, Canva subtly introduces users to the universe of premium design possibilities available on their platform.\n\nFollowing the \u2018Product-Led Growth\u2019 playbook, users are invariably introduced to enticing tooltips, gated features, teamwork capabilities, and free AI credits.\n\nAll of which systematically funnel free users towards their paid offering.\n\nEven if they don\u2019t convert in that session, users designing a business card have a high chance of returning (and re-evaluating Canva) thanks to the templates for business letterheads or branded presentations they have seen along the way.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/208892da-3978-4e06-b818-9ed096c2e632/3.png)\n\n## Rabbit Hole\n\n_**The where:**_ _3x high-signal resources to learn more_\n\n## Recommendations, friends, and sponsors\n\n**[\\[Rize\\]](https://rize.io/?code=5FF7EF&utm_source=refer&name=Strategy-Breakdowns)** **\u2192** Automatically track the apps and websites you use throughout the day.

Early content strategies that were designed to connect with niche communities showed promise. Algorithmic recommendations made it easier for users to find communities that were aligned to their specific interests.\u00a0\n\nSo Discord decided to eschew the mass-market and build a specific solution for one of the most passionate, yet forgotten communities in the world \u2013 gamers.\u00a0\n\nDiscord avoided obscurity by tapping into it.\u00a0\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ## \ud83d\udca1 | **Strategy Playbook:** Learn how to support a single vertical \u2018community\u2019, then become home for all \u2018communities\u2019. |\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5292219d-c530-4c98-a2a9-41b2b227ab93/2.png)\n\n## Breakdown\n\n_**The**_ _**how**__**:**_ _The strategic playbook boiled down to 3x key takeaways_\n\n### **1.**\u00a0\u00a0**Don\u2019t start with something for everyone \u2013 be everything for someone**\n\nWhen Discord launched in 2015, VoIP tools like Skype and Google Hangouts were building momentum in the traditionally cash-rich B2B segment.\n\nDiscord was born out of a need for more tools that promote dialogue in the gaming community \u2013 or in other words \u2013 more \u2018discord\u2019.\u00a0\n\nIn 2021, they closed $500m in funding to develop gaming-specific product features, like:\u00a0\n\n*   Server boosting\n    \n*   Custom server branding\n    \n*   Server-level monetization\n    \n*   Stage Discovery Channels\n    \n*   Premium subscriptions & Nitro\n    \n*   Quests, allowing users to demo new games\n    \n*   SDKs and APIs to support custom integrations\n    \n\nDiscord leans into them.\u00a0\n\nThis has earned them a great deal of trust with their loyal user base. Their freemium product eliminates any meaningful barriers to entry for new users. And their server functionality, such as the ability to create multiple voice channels in a single server (vs. a large group chat), is conducive to building the micro communities that long-tail gamers crave.\u00a0\n\nDiscord perfected the formula for gaming \u2013 but gamers alone don\u2019t justify their valuation.\u00a0\n\nIn 2021 during the pandemic, Discord hit the gas on expanding beyond gaming, looking to become home to other communities such as:\u00a0\n\n*   Arts\n    \n*   Film\n    \n*   Music\n    \n*   Education\n    \n*   Technology\n    \n\nTheir expansion strategy worked. _Extremely well_.\u00a0\n\nA massive [78% of users today report](https://www.cloudwards.net/discord-statistics/?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-discord-won-communities) they use Discord for non-gaming activities equally or more frequently than they do for gaming activities.\u00a0\n\n*   **Automatic roles based on team structure \u2192** Automatically assign roles to users in the San Francisco & Bay Area Server based on where they live\n    \n*   **Server Bots with game updates \u2192** Server Bots that source relevant information for fantasy football managers in real-time\n    \n\nThis has supercharged their growth to nearly [200M MAU.](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/number-of-discord-users/?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-discord-won-communities#section-1)\u00a0\n\nDiscord users skew young, with 60% under 25, and 90% under 35.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2996, "end_char_idx": 7224, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f592459e-e3c5-4396-8c17-0d27a926d84e": {"__data__": {"id_": "f592459e-e3c5-4396-8c17-0d27a926d84e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/how-discord-won-communities"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/how-discord-won-communities", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/how-discord-won-communities"}, "hash": "d3632e5f5556e9e5c43143664bcb99faaec8f155f41a085d07efabec2e87f8ec", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "62e01aed-8892-4195-a142-be75640fb76c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {"page_id": "https://strategybreakdowns.com/p/how-discord-won-communities"}, "hash": "44097038742039acab2e5202b1fff338453a6b292b2ee9f5576b7371d6c9607c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "*   **Automatic roles based on team structure \u2192** Automatically assign roles to users in the San Francisco & Bay Area Server based on where they live\n    \n*   **Server Bots with game updates \u2192** Server Bots that source relevant information for fantasy football managers in real-time\n    \n\nThis has supercharged their growth to nearly [200M MAU.](https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/number-of-discord-users/?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-discord-won-communities#section-1)\u00a0\n\nDiscord users skew young, with 60% under 25, and 90% under 35.

Zapier generated a template for each type of landing page.\n    \n2.  When onboarding new app partners, Zapier suggested they write the description and summary for each page associated with their app.\n    \n3.  Zapier incentivised partners to create this content by pitching themselves as a growth channel - with the amount of traffic Zapier generated, it made sense for partners to optimise the copy throughout their funnel.\n    \n4.  To expand the depth of partner app pages, Zapier\u2019s public \u2018Zapbook\u2019 allowed users to share their custom automations - each user-generated \u2018Zap\u2019 grew the library of use cases and associated organic SEO content.\n    \n\nThe results:\n\n*   Each page was unique, benefitting SEO rankings.\n    \n*   Each page was written by the people most suited to pitch the value of the app, integration, or use case.\n    \n*   Each page was systematised and outsourced, requiring diminishing incremental effort for Zapier over time.\n

the background, Nvidia had spent billions of dollars developing the [DGX-1](https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/Data-Center/dgx-1/dgx-1-rhel-datasheet-nvidia-us-808336-r3-web.pdf?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-nvidia-donates-free-products), an ultra-powerful processor embedded with chips designed specifically for machine and deep learning.\u00a0\n\nWhat did Nvidia do when the DGX was ready for primetime?\u00a0\n\nThey decided to give it away for free to OpenAI, who was only 6-months old at the time.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/38c46805-a8ce-41ac-9f51-6b6876c69398/Untitled_design__4_.png?t=1722864669)\n\nNvidia

Silicon Valley and the entire industry.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n[According to their 2016 10-K](https://s201.q4cdn.com/141608511/files/doc_financials/annual/2016/NV2016_AnnualReport_and_Proxy.pdf?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-nvidia-donates-free-products), Nvidia had more than 6,500 full-time employees assigned to research, and they spent more than $1.3 billion on that function throughout the year.\n\nHow could they be willing to give away a processor that retailed for $129K and took literal years and billions to make?\u00a0\n\nNvidia saw the move as an investment, not a gift.\n\nThey understood that the faster AI companies like OpenAI companies could develop their [Generative Pre-Trained Transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-nvidia-donates-free-products) (GPTs) and [other

by Microsoft in 2023.\n\nNivida\u2019s largest customer last year?\u00a0\n\nYou guessed it.\u00a0\n\nMicrosoft.\u00a0\n\nUp until 2016, Nvidia had a difficult time separating themselves from the pack of other [\u201dFabless\u201d chip companies](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/semiconductor-ecosystem-explained-steve-blank/?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-nvidia-donates-free-products).\u00a0\n\nTheir GPUs were perceived as valuable for specific use cases like gaming or video content services, but perhaps not strong enough to support the enterprise requirements that were typically delivered by incumbents Qualcomm and Broadcom.\u00a0\n\nIntel even [sanctioned a research study](https://www.top500.org/news/nvidia-rebuts-intels-claims-of-xeon-phi-superiority-in-deep-learning/?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-nvidia-donates-free-products) during the launch of their Xeon Phi, a competitor to the DGX, to highlight the futility of Nvidia\u2019s flagship product.\u00a0\n\nJensen Huang knew it was important to control the narrative around the capabilities of his supercomputer. Huang also knew the timing of his photo opp was precarious \u2013 only days before the [annual Intel Developer Conference](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2016/08/18/why-nvidia-gave-musks-ai-non-profit-openai-a-supercomputer?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-nvidia-donates-free-products#close-modal), where Intel was set to unveil their Xeon.\n\nThis kicked-off a roadshow of sorts, with Huang taking a proactive role in transforming Nvidia\u2019s image from a supplier to the gaming industry into a global superpower.\u00a0\n\nHe developed close personal relationships with the other leaders of the \u201c[Magnificent 7](https://www.investopedia.com/magnificent-seven-stocks-8402262?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-nvidia-donates-free-products),\u201d along with bosses at:\u00a0\n\n*   Mercedes\n    \n*   Volkswagen\n    \n*   MIT\n    \n*   IBM\n    \n*   Stanford\n    \n*   University of Toronto\n    \n\nNvidia is now a global phenomenon.\n\n### **3\\.** **Recurring gifts = recurring results**\n\nThe relationship with OpenAI yielded promising early results. By the time OpenAI unveiled GPT-3 (ChatGPT) in 2022, Nvidia was certain they had a winner on their hands.\n\nBut that didn\u2019t stop them from extending more generosity.\u00a0\n\nAlong the way, they co-developed more than 200 research papers with OpenAI, where Nvidia contributed:\n\n*   Hardware developments\n    \n*   Software integrations\n    \n*   Dedicated headcount\n    \n\nThey now boast similar arrangements with [IBM](https://newsroom.ibm.com/IBM-to-drive-enterprise-ready-AI-adoption-at-scale-in-collaboration-with-NVIDIA?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-nvidia-donates-free-products) and [Meta](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/meta-ai-supercomputer-dgx/?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-nvidia-donates-free-products), amongst others.\u00a0\n\nAnd Nvidia is poised to [follow their playbook](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-supercharges-hopper-the-worlds-leading-ai-computing-platform?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=why-nvidia-donates-free-products) from the initial DGX-1 as they prepare to launch their much anticipated HGX-100 and 200 products this year.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nBy constantly gifting their latest product to their strategic partners, Nvidia has helped to create an AI ecosystem _that can only succeed_ with the support of chipmakers\u2026 like Nvidia.\u00a0\n\nEarly returns on that strategy seem to be promising.

You couldn\u2019t find a creative tool that didn\u2019t prompt you to pull an Unsplash photo directly into your project.\n\nWith each partner eagerly focussed on growing their own product, the Unsplash library proliferated exponentially.\n\n3 years after launch, Unsplash API partners [accounted for 30 percent](https://unsplash.com/history?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=unsplash-s-viral-distribution-playbook) of the distribution power of Unsplash.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/25cbf49f-bc7b-4c49-9b70-aa04581d3652/Untitled__14_.png?t=1705935957)\n\n### **3.**\u00a0Make marketing \u2018products\u2019, not marketing \u2018content\u2019.\n\nWhen you create value and give it away for free, the internet pays attention.\n\nThe most common version of this: Create free content \u2192 if it\u2019s valuable, people share it.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ce325231-7d29-4d9c-9bce-46ba8f09623b/image__1_.jpg?t=1705936339)\n\nUnsplash was more than a \u2018useful\u2019 blog post.

do so, he made sure SSENSE found ways to add value to customers in ways beyond the purely transactional.\n\nAs a counterpoint to common high-fashion stereotypes of exclusivity, SSENSE established an accessible yet aspirational gateway into the culture through:\u00a0\n\n1.  **Editorialised content:** Offering distinct cultural perspectives with minimal marketing.\n    \n2.  **Visual exploration:** Providing inspiration through an emphasis on expertly curated styling.\n    \n3.  **Experimental collaborations:** Creating immersive and avant-garde memorable experiences that stand out from the traditional.\n    \n\nWith global curation and delivery of over 700 brands across 150 countries, SSENSE's unconventional tactics created unique ways for the brand to connect with customers, differentiate itself within its competitive market, and garner mindshare to become a destination _within the culture_.\n\n|     |     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ## \ud83d\udca1 | **Strategy Playbook:** Craft

_**how**__**:**_ _The strategic playbook boiled down to 3x key takeaways_\n\n### **1.**\u00a0**Have a cultural point of view**\n\nWhat immediately distinguishes SSENSE as an e-commerce platform is its magazine-like presentation.\n\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Z_XuVGfjYjV9qlxHb5GnhJrYfndAu6lHdf2crobN9rgKt3IJXBfgFkpMCOSD8xu5Ke2p6XQkB4nWZ45giJeCUoy-rAX-5MohTpvoN8gSksifr-SWH1CxoNKzvO_TUdGjJPOTLqpnLb-gxRBIsraslTw)\n\nSSENSE takes the idea that \"every company is a media company\" to the next level:\u00a0\n\n*   Content is prominently featured above the fold on their landing page\n    \n*   Professional writers, not marketers, craft the content\n    \n*   Products tend to be more in the background of the content\n    \n\n_Why is this effective?_\n\nBy prioritising stories and interviews over product-centric content, SSENSE builds credibility and an 'emotional connection' with its customers while also attracting new audiences.\u00a0\n\nSSENSE has a unique focus and approach to the styling of its products.\u00a0\n\nRather than photos focused on singular products and their details, they are styled with other brands they carry, mixing streetwear and high-end luxury, established and emerging, to create unique outfits.\u00a0\n\nThrough this, customers can see products in valuable new contexts:\n\nIt shows a product's versatility and how it might integrate with their current style choices or _inspire trying something new_.\n\nRecognising curation as a strength, the platform was designed to deemphasise search to lean into visual exploration.\n\nEven their mobile app was inspired by the iOS Photos app to create an easily navigable lookbook of style inspiration.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8d6ac2fc-090f-481f-a64b-97886054551a/Untitled__3_.jpg?t=1709518350)\n\nThis

surface area through experimental collaborations**\n\nIn addition to its robust core platform, SSENSE makes it a point to step outside the box to experiment with retail activations and microsites.\n\nThis allows them to create immersive brand experiences while further cutting through the noise of a crowded market:\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f3bff478-0f76-438f-86b1-064d565e4a47/Untitled_design.png?t=1709227030)\n\nThe launch of Pharrell Williams's skincare brand Humanrace featured five floors of physical retail activations at SSENSE's flagship store in Montreal, each offering a different look into the brand's creative vision.\n\nA [microsite](https://everythingelse.ssense.com/humanrace?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=how-ssense-became-a-cultural-protagonist) highlighted these experiences with a look into sculptural designs, a curated clothing archive, and more, immersing new customers into the growing community and vision of \"Humanrace Wellbeings.\"\n\nThe intention behind creating these standout experiments may forego immediate transactional benefits. It's a longer-term strategy of cultivating authenticity and building credibility, as Damiette said, \"one stone at a time.\"\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/208892da-3978-4e06-b818-9ed096c2e632/3.png)\n\n## Rabbit Hole\n\n_**The where:**_ _3x high-signal resources to learn more_\n\n**That\u2019s all for today\u2019s issue, folks!**\n\nWhat did you think of today\u2019s edition?

how:**_ _The strategic playbook boiled down to 3x key takeaways_\n\n**1:**\u00a0**Build something everyone needs**\n\nThere aren\u2019t many software categories that 100% of employees in an organisation need a paid license for:\n\nWord processing, task management, instant messaging, and a couple of others.\n\nHistorically, screen recording SaaS tools were pitched to specific personas like marketers and designers for publishing demos.\n\nA 1,000 employee company might buy 5 licenses.\n\nLoom promised businesses a new way for _all employees_ to communicate, and save time by doing so.\n\n\u201cVideo messaging\u201d saves everyone a meeting, can be watched at 2x speed, and lets recipients jump around to focus on relevant topics.\n\nThe same 1,000 employee company can\u2019t wait to buy 1,000 licenses.\n\n**2: Make it remarkably frictionless**\n\nImagine you\u2019re an employee wanting to share a screen recording to a colleague.\n\nThe old way:\n\n*   Download a screen recorder\n    \n*   Install the screen recorder locally\n    \n*   Guess the correct video dimensions\n    \n*   Accidentally record without any audio\n    \n*   Wait 10 minutes for the mp4 file to render\n    \n*   Figure out how to add webcam and voiceover\n    \n*   Write an email to explain the recording\u2019s context\n    \n*   Attach the file (before realising it\u2019s too large for email)\n    \n*   Colleague downloads the file, watches on VLC, and emails a reply\n    \n\nThe new way:\n\n*   Loom extension\n    \n*   One-click to record\n    \n*   Video renders instantly\n    \n*   One-click copy a share link\n    \n*   Colleague replies within Loom\n    \n\nLoom took every single step in the workflow and made it frictionless.\n\nThey made sending screen recordings to a colleague _so easy_, the videos became communication tools themselves.\n\n**3: Leverage local network effects**\n\nWhen users send a Loom to those not signed up yet, the receiver can still view the Loom and send a reply.\n\nIn other words, even non-users experience fast time-to-value.\n\nThe modal at the end of a Loom (a) reinforces the value by referencing the time saved, and (b) prompts the receiver to sign up.\n\n![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/4157fe80-9016-4db5-9f87-99aef340c8aa/Screen_Shot_2023-10-30_at_2.16.15_AM__1_.png)\n\nBecause Looms are inherently shareable within an organisation, employees become net promoters of the tool _just by using it_.\n\nSimilar to the \u201cinvite a friend\u201d mechanic that built many of today\u2019s tech giants, employees without a license end up signing up for one organically.\n\nEven with only a handful of initial signups, over time, companies end up becoming a _company that uses Loom._\n\n!", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 3157, "end_char_idx": 6578, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n",

I realised that I could sell my in-game gold for USD, then use that money to pay for my RuneScape membership.\n\nFrom that point onwards, the [metagame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagame?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1-year-into-strategy-breakdowns) I was playing changed entirely.\n\nThe game became about \u2018farming\u2019. Albeit fairly [grey-hat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_hat?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1-year-into-strategy-breakdowns), in many ways it was **a far more exciting and 3-dimensional challenge.**\n\n\u2192 I\u2019d create a small army of [bot](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Botting?utm_source=strategybreakdowns.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=1-year-into-strategy-breakdowns) accounts to farm gold simultaneously.\n\n\u2192 I\u2019d use a remote screen controller on my jailbroken iPod Touch to check on the bot farm at school.\n\n\u2192 I\u2019d coordinate with friends to manage the bot farm and run the RWT \u2018store\u2019.\n\nNote: The real-world value of the gold I was accumulating was nothing remarkable, but it was enough to keep me hooked on the metagame:\n\n*   Selling some of it to pay for RuneScape membership (main and bot accounts)\n    \n*   Reinvesting into in-game items to improve the bot farm\n    \n*   Buying other video games\n    \n\nThe great irony was that most of the profits weren\u2019t sold for USD - they were just funnelled back into my main account\u2026 to buy the best items for skilling, questing and PKing.\n\nI was less addicted to **making real money** than **playing the \u2018game\u2019 itself**; hanging out with internet buddies, continuously improving the operation, and finding creative ways to scale.\n\n\u2026\n\nWhy am I telling you all this?\n\nIt\u2019s **not** to say \u2018_I was destined to build an online business from a young age\u2019_. **(yawn)**\n\nSure, you can distill some parallels around creating leverage, capital allocation, system design etc.\n\nBut I actually think there are a few lessons I learnt at the time, that today, manifest in peculiar but undeniable ways.\n\n**Community-first**\n\nIt was only fun because I was playing with other people.
